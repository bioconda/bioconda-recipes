Bioconda has finished the [GCC7 migration](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/issues/13578). If you are dealing with C/C++ or Python package it can be that you need to rebuild other dependent packages. [Bioconda utils - update-pinning](https://bioconda.github.io/updating.html#updating-recipes-for-a-pinning-change) will assist you with that. If you have any questions please use [issue 13578](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/issues/13578).
