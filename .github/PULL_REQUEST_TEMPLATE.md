Bioconda requires reviews prior to merging pull-requests (PRs). To facilitate this, once your PR is passing tests and ready to be merged, please add the `please review & merge` label so other members of the bioconda community can have a look at your PR and either make suggestions or merge it. Note that if you are not already a member of the bioconda project (meaning that you can't add this label), please ping `@bioconda/core` so that your PR can be reviewed and merged (please note if you'd like to be added to the bioconda project). Please see https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/issues/15332 for more details.
