Thanks for opening your first pull request! As you're new to bioconda, please read through our [documentation about contributing recipes](https://bioconda.github.io/contributing.html). If you need help, please ping one of the following teams:

 - `@bioconda/haskel` for Haskell packages
 - `@bioconda/lib` for C/C++ packages
 - `@bioconda/osx` for help with builds erroring on OSX
 - `@bioconda/perl` for perl packages
 - `@bioconda/python` for python packages

Please ping `@bioconda/core` when your pull request is passing tests and ready to be merged. If you would like to be added to the bioconda team (so you can merge your own pull requests once all tests have passed) please mention that to `@bioconda/core` and they'll happily add you to the bioconda group.
