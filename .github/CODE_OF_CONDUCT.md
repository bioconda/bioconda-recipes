Bioconda Code of Conduct
========================

- Be respectful
- Be welcoming
- Be considerate
- Focus on what's best for the community
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Use welcoming and inclusive language

Reporting an issue
------------------
If you see a violation of the code of conduct, please report it to a Bioconda core
member. You can find core members at
https://github.com/orgs/bioconda/teams/core/members, and emails on each users'
GitHub profile page.

Enforcement
-----------
Upon receiving a report, the Bioconda core team will meet privately to discuss
the matter and determine the best course of action.

Possible responses may include:

- taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred)
- a private reprimand from the core members to the individual(s) involved. In
  this case, a core member will deliver that reprimand via email, copying the
  rest of the core.
- a public reprimand. In this case a core member will deliver the reprimand via
  the same channel as the violation occurred (e.g., via comment on PR or issue)

- an imposed vacation (e.g., asking the individual to refrain from participating
  for a week). A core member will deliver a request for the individual to take
  such a "vacation" voluntarily, but if they don't disagree then a temporary
  ban may be imposed.

- a permanent or temporary ban from Bioconda

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the core will
contact the original reporter and discuss the resolution and will note any
feedback for the record, but is not obligated to act on such feedback.

The core will never publicly discuss the issue; any public statements will be
made by core members.

If the incident involves a core member, the core member must recuse themselves
from the response process.
