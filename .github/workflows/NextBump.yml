# 1. Compare version of recipe with latest release
# 2. If version is newer than latest release, bump the version
# 3. Download assets, get SHA256, update SH256 in recipe
# 4. Checkout branch, reset to master (or use non-master branch synced without the workflow)
# 5. Add and commit recipe to repo
# 6. Create PR to bioconda
