"""
The basic idea to nest logical expressions is instead of trying to denest
things via distribution, we add new variables. So if we have some logical
expression expr, we replace it with x and add expr <-> x to the clauses,
where x is a new variable, and expr <-> x is recursively evaluated in the
same way, so that the final clauses are ORs of atoms.

To use this, create a new Clauses object with the max var, for instance, if you
already have [[1, 2, -3]], you would use C = Clause(3).  All functions return
a new literal, which represents that function, or True or False if the expression
can be resolved fully. They may also add new clauses to C.clauses, which
will then be delivered to the SAT solver.

All functions take atoms as arguments (an atom is an integer, representing a
literal or a negated literal, or boolean constants True or False; that is,
it is the callers' responsibility to do the conversion of expressions
recursively. This is done because we do not have data structures
representing the various logical classes, only atoms.

The polarity argument can be set to True or False if you know that the literal
being used will only be used in the positive or the negative, respectively
(e.g., you will only use x, not -x).  This will generate fewer clauses. It
is probably best if you do not take advantage of this directly, but rather
through the Require and Prevent functions.

    Given a set of clauses, find a minimal unsatisfiable subset (an
    unsatisfiable core)

    A set is a minimal unsatisfiable subset if no proper subset is
    unsatisfiable.  A set of clauses may have many minimal unsatisfiable
    subsets of different sizes.

    If log=True, progress bars will be displayed with the progress.

    sat should be a function that takes a tuple of clauses and returns True if
    the clauses are satisfiable and False if they are not.  The algorithm will
    work with any order-reversing function (reversing the order of subset and
    the order False < True), that is, any function where (A <= B) iff (sat(B)
    <= sat(A)), where A <= B means A is a subset of B and False < True).

    Algorithm
    =========

    Algorithm suggested from
    http://www.slideshare.net/pvcpvc9/lecture17-31382688. We do a binary
    search on the clauses by splitting them in halves A and B. If A or B is
    UNSAT, we use that and repeat. Otherwise, we recursively check A, but each
    time we do a sat query, we include B, until we have a minimal subset A* of
    A such that A* U B is UNSAT. Then we find a minimal subset B* of B such
    that A* U B* is UNSAT. Then A* U B* will be a minimal unsatisfiable subset
    of the original set of clauses.

    Proof: If some proper subset C of A* U B* is UNSAT, then there is some
    clause c in A* U B* not in C. If c is in A*, then that means (A* - {c}) U
    B* is UNSAT, and hence (A* - {c}) U B is UNSAT, since it is a superset,
    which contradicts A* being the minimal subset of A with such
    property. Similarly, if c is in B, then A* U (B* - {c}) is UNSAT, but B* -
    {c} is a strict subset of B*, contradicting B* being the minimal subset of
    B with this property.
