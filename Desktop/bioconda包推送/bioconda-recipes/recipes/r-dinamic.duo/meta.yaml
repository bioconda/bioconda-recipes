  summary: In tumor tissue, underlying genomic instability can lead to DNA copy number alterations,
    e.g., copy number gains or losses. Sporadic copy number alterations occur randomly
    throughout the genome, whereas recurrent alterations are observed in the same genomic
    region across multiple independent samples, perhaps because they provide a selective
    growth advantage. Here we use cyclic shift permutations to identify recurrent copy
    number alterations in a single cohort or recurrent copy number differences in two
    cohorts based on a common set of genomic markers. Additional functionality is provided
    to perform downstream analyses, including the creation of summary files and graphics.
    DiNAMIC.Duo builds upon the original DiNAMIC package of Walter et al. (2011) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq717>
    and leverages the theory developed in Walter et al. (2015) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asv046>.
    A manuscript based on DiNAMIC.Duo is currently under development.
