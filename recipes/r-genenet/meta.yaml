  summary: 'Analyzes gene expression (time series) data with focus on the inference of gene networks.
    In particular, GeneNet implements the methods of Schaefer and  Strimmer (2005a,b,c)
    and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2006, 2007) for learning large-scale gene association
    networks (including assignment of putative directions).  '
