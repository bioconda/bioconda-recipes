    summary: >
      MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial
      communities (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryotes and Viruses) from metagenomic
      shotgun sequencing data with species level resolution. From version 2.0
      MetaPhlAn is also able to identify specific strains (in the not-so-frequent
      cases in which the sample contains a previously sequenced strains) and to
      track strains across samples for all species.
