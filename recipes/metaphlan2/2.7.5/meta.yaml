  summary: >
    MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial
    communities (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryotes and Viruses) from metagenomic
    shotgun sequencing data with species level resolution. From version 2.0
    MetaPhlAn is also able to identify specific strains (in the not-so-frequent
    cases in which the sample contains a previously sequenced strains) and to
    track strains across samples for all species.
