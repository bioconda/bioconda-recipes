  summary: 'Placental cell DNA methylation data from GEO accession GSE159526'
  description: '19 term and 9 first trimester placental chorionic villi and matched cell-sorted samples ran on Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC DNA methylation microarrays. This data was made available on GEO accession [GSE159526](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159526). Both the raw and processed data has been made available on \code{ExperimentHub}. Raw unprocessed data formatted as an RGChannelSet object for integration and normalization using minfi and other existing Bioconductor packages. Processed normalized data is also available as a DNA methylation \code{matrix}, with a corresponding phenotype information as a \code{data.frame} object.'
