  description: |-
    SeqStats outputs several stats on a FASTQ file.

    Outputted stats:

    - Bases
       - Total number
       - Base qualities, with the number of bases having that quality
       - Number of each nucleotide
    - Reads
       - Total number
       - Number of reads with 'N' bases
       - minimum length
       - maximum length
       - A histogram of the average base qualities
       - The quality encoding (Sanger, solexa etc.)
       - A histogram of the read lengths.

extra:
  notes: 'biopet-seqstat is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell
    script. By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The command
    that runs the program is ''biopet-seqstat''. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify memory options directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence. For example run it with ''biopet-seqstat
    -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
