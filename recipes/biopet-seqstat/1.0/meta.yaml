  summary: SeqStat is a package that contains tools to generate stats from a FastQ file, merge those stats for multiple samples, and validate the generated stats files.
  description: "SeqStat is a package that contains tools\nto generate stats from a\
    \ FastQ file,\nmerge those stats for multiple samples,\nand validate the generated\
    \ stats files.\n\n     \n#### Mode - Generate\n\nGenerate outputs several stats\
    \ on a FASTQ file.\n\nOutputted stats:\n\n- Bases\n   - Total number\n   - Base\
    \ qualities, with the number of bases having that quality\n   - Number of each\
    \ nucleotide\n- Reads\n   - Total number\n   - minimum length\n   - maximum length\n\
    \   - A histogram of the average base qualities\n   - The quality encoding (Sanger,\
    \ solexa etc.)\n   - A histogram of the read lengths.\n    \n        \n\n####\
    \ Mode - Merge\n\nThis module will merge seqstat files together and keep the sample/library/readgroup\
    \ structure.\nIf required it's also possible to collapse this, the output file\
    \ then des not have any sample/library/readgroup structure.\n    \n        \n\n\
    #### Mode - Validate\n\nA file from SeqStat will validate the input files.\nIf\
    \ aggregation values can not be regenerated the file is considered corrupt.\n\
    This should only happen when the user will edit the seqstat file manually.\n\n\

extra:
  notes: 'biopet-seqstat is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell
    script. By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The command
    that runs the program is ''biopet-seqstat''. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify memory options directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence. For example run it with ''biopet-seqstat
    -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
