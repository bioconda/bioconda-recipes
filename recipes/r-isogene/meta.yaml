  summary: 'Offers framework for testing for monotonic relationship between gene expression and
    doses in a microarray experiment. Several testing procedures including the global
    likelihood-ratio test (Bartholomew, 1961), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus (1976),
    M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007) are used to test for the
    monotonic trend in gene expression with respect to doses. BH (Benjamini and Hochberg
    1995) and BY (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2004) FDR controlling procedures are applied
    to adjust the raw p-values obtained from the permutations.   '
