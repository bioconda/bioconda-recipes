  summary: Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation  of hash digests of arbitrary
    R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256,  crc32, xxhash and murmurhash algorithms)
    permitting easy comparison of R language objects, as well as a function 'hmac()'
    to create hash-based message authentication code. . The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest
    is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1  and sha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1
    and FIPS-180-2,  and the crc32 algorithm is described in  ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt.
    . For md5, sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone implementations
    that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code from the zlib library is
    used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron D. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the
    implementation by Yann Collet is used. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane
    Day is used. . Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for  cryptographic
    purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely  tested) libraries such as OpenSSL
    should be used.
