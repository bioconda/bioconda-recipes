  summary: Accelerating the deduplication and collapsing process for reads with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI).
  description:
    UMIs are a popular way to identify duplicate DNA/RNA reads caused by PCR amplification. This requires software for 
    collapsing duplicate reads with the same UMI, while accounting for sequencing/PCR errors. This tool implements many 
    efficient algorithms for orders-of-magnitude faster UMI deduplication than previous tools (UMI-tools, etc.), 
    while maintaining similar functionality. This is achieved by using faster data structures with n-grams and BK-trees, 
    along other techniques that are carefully implemented to scale well to larger datasets and longer UMIs. Users of 
    UMICollapse have reported speedups from taking hours or days to run with a previous tool to taking only a few 
    minutes with this tool with real datasets! doi 10.7717/peerj.8275.
