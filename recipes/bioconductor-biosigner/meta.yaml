  summary: 'Feature selection is critical in omics data analysis to extract restricted
    and meaningful molecular signatures from complex and high-dimension data, and
    to build robust classifiers. This package implements a new method to assess the
    relevance of the variables for the prediction performances of the classifier.
    The approach can be run in parallel with the PLS-DA, Random Forest, and SVM binary
    classifiers. The signatures and the corresponding ''restricted'' models are returned,
    enabling future predictions on new datasets. A Galaxy implementation of the package
    is available within the Workflow4metabolomics.org online infrastructure for computational
    metabolomics.'
