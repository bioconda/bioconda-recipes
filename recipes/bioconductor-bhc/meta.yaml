  summary: 'The method performs bottom-up hierarchical clustering, using a Dirichlet
    Process (infinite mixture) to model uncertainty in the data and Bayesian model
    selection to decide at each step which clusters to merge.  This avoids several
    limitations of traditional methods, for example how many clusters there should
    be and how to choose a principled distance metric.  This implementation accepts
    multinomial (i.e. discrete, with 2+ categories) or time-series data. This version
    also includes a randomised algorithm which is more efficient for larger data sets.'
