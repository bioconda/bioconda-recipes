source:
  # Note the "v" before the version number -- we prefix strainFlye's release
  # tags with a "v" (e.g. "v0.2.0"), so we need to include the "v" here in
  # order to point to the correct tags. (However, although a tag might be named
  # "v0.2.0", the actual version is still "0.2.0", hence why we don't just
  # include the "v" in the version variable.)
  #
  # For comparison, flye's meta.yaml
  # (https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/master/recipes/flye/meta.yaml)
  # does not do this because its release tags are (mostly) not prefixed with a "v".
