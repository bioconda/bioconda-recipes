# We need to install samtools, bcftools, and htslib alongside pysam --
# and in particular we versions of these tools that pysam is ok with.
# Note that samtools, bcftools, and htslib all seem to use the same
# versioning system, which makes our life easier.
#
# Using versions of these three dependencies < 1.10 seems to be ok with
# pysam < 0.16: see
# https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/master/recipes/pysam/0.15.2/meta.yaml
# I believe this is because the 1.10 release included changes to the
# "Application Binary Interface" these tools provide -- later versions of
# these tools give us an error when trying to run "import pysam" in
# Python, e.g. we get the error message "ImportError: libhts.so.2: cannot
# open shared object file: No such file or directory" (for discussion, see
# https://github.com/MikkelSchubert/paleomix/issues/38).

  # Note the "v" before the version number -- we prefix strainFlye's release
  # tags with a "v" (e.g. "v0.2.0"), so we need to include the "v" here in
  # order to point to the correct tags. (However, although a tag might be named
  # "v0.2.0", the actual version is still "0.2.0", hence why we don't just
  # include the "v" in the version variable.)
  #
  # For comparison, flye's meta.yaml
  # (https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/master/recipes/flye/meta.yaml)
  # does not do this because its release tags are (mostly) not prefixed with a "v".
