    # muscle is not needed at runtime but:
    #  - patching setup.py to remove these binaries will make the building pipeline to fail
    #  - these binaries make the package "noarch impossible"
    #  - these binaries would clash with the "muscle" package
    # solution: remove them after the build pipeline has run,
    #           so they do not make it to the final package
    - rm -f ${PREFIX}/bin/muscle ${PREFIX}/bin/muscle_macOS
