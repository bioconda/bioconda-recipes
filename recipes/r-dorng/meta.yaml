  summary: This package provides functions to perform reproducible parallel foreach loops, using
    independent random streams as generated by L'Ecuyer's combined multiple-recursive
    generator [L'Ecuyer (1999)]. It enables to easily convert standard %dopar% loops
    into fully reproducible loops, independently of the number of workers, the task
    scheduling strategy, or the chosen parallel environment and associated foreach backend.
