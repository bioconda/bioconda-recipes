  summary: Lightweight tool to compile simple string input into long genomic sequences
  description: |
    Seqstr is designed to provide a concise and flexible way to specify long genomic sequences that can be used for downstream analysis. For example, it can be used by web servers to avoid transferring long genomic sequences. Seqstr is also a format specification, which can be implemented in different languages. We also provide a test suite for verifying an implementation.
