  summary: "Implements the network clustering algorithm described in Newman (2006) <doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.74.036104>.
    The complete iterative algorithm comprises of two steps. In the first step, the
    network is expressed in terms of its leading eigenvalue and eigenvector and recursively
    partition into two communities. Partitioning occurs if the maximum positive eigenvalue
    is greater than the tolerance (10e-5) for the current partition, and if it results
    in a positive contribution to the Modularity. Given an initial separation using
    the leading eigen step, 'rSpectral' then continues to maximise for the change in
    Modularity using a fine-tuning step - or variate thereof. The first stage here is
    to find the node which, when moved from one community to another, gives the maximum
    change in Modularity. This node\u2019s community is then fixed and we repeat the
    process until all nodes have been moved. The whole process is repeated from this
    new state until the change in the Modularity, between the new and old state, is
    less than the predefined tolerance. A slight variant of the fine-tuning step, which
    can improve speed of the calculation, is also provided. Instead of moving each node
    into each community in turn, we only consider moves of neighbouring nodes, found
    in different communities, to the community of the current node of interest. The
    two steps process is repeatedly applied to each new community found, subdivided
    each community into two new communities, until we are unable to find any division
    that results in a positive change in Modularity."

Partitioning occurs if the maximum positive eigenvalue is greater than the tolerance (10e-5) for the current partition, and if it results in a positive contribution to the Modularity.

This nodes community is then fixed and we repeat the process until all nodes have been moved.
