  summary: Includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML file. Thus, making HTML reports
    is easy. Includes a function that allows redirection on the fly, which appears to
    be very useful for teaching purpose, as the student can keep a copy of the produced
    output to keep all that he did during the course. Package comes with a vignette
    describing how to write HTML reports for statistical analysis. Finally, a driver
    for 'Sweave' allows to parse HTML flat files containing R code and to automatically
    write the corresponding outputs (tables and graphs).
