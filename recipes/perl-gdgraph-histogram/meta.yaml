requirements:
  # Explicitly list libgd 2.1.0 as a requirement to force use of the BioBuilds
  # version; needed there's something broken in conda's dependency resolution
  # system that causes it to go out and grab the one from the "defaults"
  # channel, even though perl-gdgraph and perl-gd explicitly request version
  # 2.1.0 from "biobuilds". (Can't use libgd from "defaults" because the OS X
  # dylib name is different and causes huge breaks in existing packages.)
