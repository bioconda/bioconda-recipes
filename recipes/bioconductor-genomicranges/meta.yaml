  summary: 'The ability to efficiently represent and manipulate genomic annotations
    and alignments is playing a central role when it comes to analyzing high-throughput
    sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The GenomicRanges package defines general purpose
    containers for storing and manipulating genomic intervals and variables defined
    along a genome. More specialized containers for representing and manipulating
    short alignments against a reference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of
    an experiment, are defined in the GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages
    respectively. Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges infrastructure.'
