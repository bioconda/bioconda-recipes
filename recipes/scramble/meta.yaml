  summary: Soft Clipped Read Alignment Mapper
  description: |
    SCRAMble identifies clusters of soft clipped reads in a BAM file, builds consensus sequences,
    aligns to representative L1Ta, AluYa5, and SVA-E sequences, and outputs MEI calls

extra:
  identifiers:
    - doi:10.1038/s41436-020-0749-x
  notes: |
    SCRAMble runs as a two-step process. First cluster_identifier is used to generate soft-clipped
    read cluster consensus sequences. Second, SCRAMble.R analyzes the cluster file for likely MEIs.
    Custom wrapper script scramble.sh is provided to help setting location of SCRAMble.R script,
    and values for --install-dir and --mei-refs params.
