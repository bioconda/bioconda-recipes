  summary: Provides a mechanism for chaining commands with a new forward-pipe operator, %>%.
    This operator will forward a value, or the result of an expression, into the next
    function call/expression. There is flexible support for the type of right-hand side
    expressions. For more information, see package vignette. To quote Rene Magritte,
    "Ceci n'est pas un pipe."
