  summary: Fitting possibly high dimensional penalized regression models. The penalty structure 
    can be any combination of an L1 penalty (lasso and fused lasso), an L2 penalty (ridge) and a 
    positivity constraint on the regression coefficients. The supported regression models are 
    linear, logistic and Poisson regression and the Cox Proportional Hazards model. 
    Cross-validation routines allow optimization of the tuning parameters.
