  description: |
    The success of modern proteomics was made possible by constant progression in the field of mass spectrometry. Over the course of the past years quite a few manufacturers of
    mass spectrometers have managed to establish themselfes in the field of biological research. Since aquisition and accession of mass spectra are performance critical processes,
    various performance optimized, but vendor specific and closed source formats have been developed to store raw MS data. This comes to the disadvantage for toolchain developers
    which want to provide tools for every scientist regardless of the format of their raw data.
