  summary: 'Averaged gene expression in human brain regions from Allen Brain Atlas'
  description: 'Provides the data for the gene expression enrichment analysis conducted in the package ''ABAEnrichment''. The package includes three datasets which are derived from the Allen Brain Atlas: (1) Gene expression data from Human Brain (adults) averaged across donors, (2) Gene expression data from the Developing Human Brain pooled into five age categories and averaged across donors and (3) a developmental effect score based on the Developing Human Brain expression data. All datasets are restricted to protein coding genes.'
