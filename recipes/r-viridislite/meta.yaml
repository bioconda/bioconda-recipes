  summary: "Port of the new 'matplotlib' color maps
  ('viridis' - the default -, 'magma', 'plasma' and 'inferno') to 'R'.
  'matplotlib' <http://matplotlib.org/ > is a popular plotting library
  for 'python'. These color maps are designed in such a way that
  they will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform,
  both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white.
  They are also designed to be perceived by readers with
  the most common form of color blindness.
  This is the 'lite' version of the more complete
  'viridis' package that can be found
  at <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>."
