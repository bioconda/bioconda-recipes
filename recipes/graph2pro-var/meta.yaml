  summary: "This package contains a wrapper script (graph2pro-var.sh) and component packages for two algorithms: 
graph2pro and var2pep for protein/peptide identification from metaproteomic mass spectral data with matching 
metagenomic/transcriptomic data (i.e., meta-proteogenomic approach).
The graph2pro approach is based on assembly graph for protein/peptide identification.
The var2pep aims to use the sequencing reads that cannot be assembled to further improve peptide identification."
