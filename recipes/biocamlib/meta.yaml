  summary: 'An OCaml foundation upon which a number of the bioinformatics tools are built.'
  description: |
    BiOCamLib is an OCaml foundation upon which a number of the bioinformatics tools are built,
    including KPop <https://github.com/PaoloRibeca/KPop>. It consists of four tools:
    1. RC, which can efficiently compute the reverse complement of sequences.
    2. Octopus, which is a high-throughput program to compute the transitive closure of strings.
    3. Parallel, which allows the splits and processes an input file chunk-wise using a reader/workers/writer model.
    4. FASTools, which is a Swiss-knife tool for the manipulation of FASTA/FASTQ files.
