  summary: "An efficient tool for accurately reconstructing single genomes from complex microbial communities"
  description: |
    Grouping large genomic fragments assembled from shotgun metagenomic
    sequences to deconvolute complex microbial communities, or metagenome 
    , enables the study of individual organisms and their interactions. Here we
    developed an automated metagenome binning software, called MetaBAT, which
    integrates empirical probabilistic distances of genome abundance and
    tetranucleotide frequency. Tested on both synthetic and real metagenome
    datasets, MetaBAT outperforms alternative methods in both accuracy and
    computational efficiency. Applying MetaBAT to an assembly from 1,704 human
    gut samples formed 1,634 genome bins (>200kb) in 3 hours, where 621 genome
    bins are >50% complete with <5% contamination from other species. Further
    analysis shows that the quality of these genome bins approaches manually
    curated genomes.
