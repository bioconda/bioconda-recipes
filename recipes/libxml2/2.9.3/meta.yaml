  summary: Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project
    (but usable outside of the Gnomeplatform), it is free software available under
    the MIT License. XML itself is a metalanguage to design markuplanguages, i.e.
    text language where semantic and structure are added to the content using extra
    "markup"information enclosed between angle brackets. HTML is the most well-known
    markup language. Though the libraryis written in C a variety of language bindings
    make it available in other environments.
