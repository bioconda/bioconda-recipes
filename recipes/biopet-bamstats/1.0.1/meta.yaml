    BamStats is a package that contains tools
    to generate stats from a BAM file,
    merge those stats for multiple samples,
    and validate the generated stats files.


    #### Mode - Generate

    Generate reports clipping stats, flag stats, insert size and mapping quality on a BAM file. It outputs
    a JSON file, but can optionally also output in TSV format.

    The output of the JSON file is organized in a sample - library - readgroup tree structure.
    If readgroups in the BAM file are not annotated with sample (`SM`) and library (`LB`) tags
    an error will be thrown.
    This can be fixed by using `samtools addreplacerg` or `picard AddOrReplaceReadGroups`.


    #### Mode - Merge

    This module will merge bamstats files together and keep the sample/library/readgroup structure.
    Values for the same readgroups will be added.
    It will also validate the resulting file.


    #### Mode - Validate

    Validates a BamStats file.
    If aggregation values can not be regenerated the file is considered corrupt.
    This should only happen when the file has been manually edited.

  notes: |
    biopet-bamstats is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    By default 'no default java option' is set in the wrapper.
    The command that runs the program is 'biopet-bamstats'.
    If you want to overwrite it you can specify memory options directly after your binaries.
    If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with 'biopet-bamstats -Xms512m -Xmx1g'.
