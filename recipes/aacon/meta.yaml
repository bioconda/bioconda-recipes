  summary: "AACon: A Fast Amino Acid Conservation Calculation Service"
  description:
    AACon is a set of tools implementing 17 different conservation scores
    reviewed by Valdar as well as the more complex SMERFS algorithm for
    predicting protein functional sites. AACon has been written with efficiency
    in mind and takes less than a second to calculate conservation by all 18
    methods for an alignment of 500 sequences 350 residues long on a single CPU.
    AACon exploits parallelism for the more demanding methods and to allow
    multiple methods to run simultaneously. The parallel code gives close to
    linear speedup with the number of processors, thus making it suitable for
    server applications or other demanding environments.

extra:
  notes:
    AACon is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    The shell wrapper is called "aacon" and is present on $PATH by default.
    The Java program is executed with java specified by the $JAVA_HOME
    variable. Otherwise, a "java" program from the current environment is used.
