  summary: 'Basic4Cseq is an R/Bioconductor package for basic filtering, analysis
    and subsequent visualization of 4C-seq data. Virtual fragment libraries can be
    created for any BSGenome package, and filter functions for both reads and fragments
    and basic quality controls are included. Fragment data in the vicinity of the
    experiment''s viewpoint can be visualized as a coverage plot based on a running
    median approach and a multi-scale contact profile.'
