  summary: 'Display a rectangular heatmap (intensity plot) of a data matrix. By default,
    both samples (columns) and features (row) of the matrix are sorted according to
    a hierarchical clustering, and the corresponding dendrogram is plotted. Optionally,
    panels with additional information about samples and features can be added to
    the plot.'
