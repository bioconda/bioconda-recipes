  summary: "Normalizing and denoising protein expression data from droplet-based single cell profiling"
  description: "This lightweight R package provides a method for normalizing and denoising protein
    expression data from droplet based single cell experiments. Raw protein Unique Molecular
    Index (UMI) counts from sequencing DNA-conjugated antibody derived tags (ADT) in
    droplets (e.g. 'CITE-seq') have substantial measurement noise. Our experiments and
    computational modeling revealed two major components of this noise: 1) protein-specific
    noise originating from ambient, unbound antibody encapsulated in droplets that can
    be accurately inferred via the expected protein counts detected in empty droplets,
    and 2) droplet/cell-specific noise revealed via the shared variance component associated
    with isotype antibody controls and background protein counts in each cell. This
    package normalizes and removes both of these sources of noise from raw protein data
    derived from methods such as 'CITE-seq', 'REAP-seq', 'ASAP-seq', 'TEA-seq', 'proteogenomic'
    data from the Mission Bio platform, etc. See the vignette for tutorials on how to
    integrate dsb with 'Seurat' and 'Bioconductor' and how to use dsb in 'Python'. Please
