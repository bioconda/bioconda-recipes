    summary: |
        PeptideShaker is a search engine independent platform for interpretation of proteomics identification results from multiple search engines,
        currently supporting X!Tandem, MS-GF+, MS Amanda, OMSSA, MyriMatch, Comet, Tide, Mascot, Andromeda and mzIdentML.
        By combining the results from multiple search engines, while re-calculating PTM localization scores and redoing the protein inference,
        PeptideShaker attempts to give you the best possible understanding of your proteomics data!

  notes: |
    PeptideShaker is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "peptide-shaker -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
