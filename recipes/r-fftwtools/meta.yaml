  summary: 'Provides a wrapper for several FFTW functions. This package provides access to the
    two-dimensional FFT, the multivariate FFT, and the one-dimensional real to complex
    FFT using FFTW3. The package includes the functions fftw and mvfftw which are designed
    to mimic the functionality of the R functions fft and mvfft. The FFT functions have
    a parameter that allows them to not return the redundant complex conjugate when
    the input is real data. '
