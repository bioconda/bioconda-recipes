  license: GPL-2
  summary: Methods for aggregating ranked lists, especially lists of genes. It implements the
    Robust Rank Aggregation (Kolde et. al in preparation) and some other simple algorithms
    for the task. RRA method uses a probabilistic model for aggregation that is robust
    to noise and also facilitates the calculation of significance probabilities for
    all the elements in the final ranking.
