  summary: KofamKOALA assigns K numbers to the user's sequence data by HMMER/HMMSEARCH against KOfam
  description: |
    KofamKOALA assigns K numbers to the user's sequence data by HMMER/HMMSEARCH against KOfam (a customized HMM database of KEGG Orthologs (KOs)).
    K number assignments with scores above the predefined thresholds for individual KOs are more reliable than other proposed assignments.
    Such high score assignments are highlighted with asterisks '*' in the output.
    The K number assignments facilitate the interpretation of the annotation results by linking the user's sequence data to the KEGG pathways and EC numbers.
