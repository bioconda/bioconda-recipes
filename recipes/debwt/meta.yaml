  summary: |
    A efficient method to construct BWT index of a given DNA sequence, especially
    useful for gigantic and high similar genome.
    DeBWT has good scalability to construct BWT in parallel computing.
    It is well-suited to run on multiple core servers or clusters to
    construct the BWT of large collections of genome sequences.
