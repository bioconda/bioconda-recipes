    summary: Rapid method to screen for introgression using k-mer counting
    description: |
        KCFTOOLS is a Java-based tool designed to identify genomic variations by analyzing k-mer counts between
        reference and query sequences. The tool leverages k-mer counting databases, such as those generated by
        KMC, to perform a variety of analyses, including variation detection, IBS window identification, and
        genotype matrix generation.
