  summary: Create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistics with the 'lipidomeR'. The 'lipidomeR'
    provides a streamlined pipeline for the systematic interpretation of the lipidome
    through publication-ready visualizations of regression models fitted on lipidomics
    data. With 'lipidomeR', associations between covariates and the lipidome can be
    interpreted systematically and intuitively through heatmaps, where lipids are categorized
    by the lipid class and are presented on two-dimensional maps organized by the lipid
    size and level of saturation. This way, the 'lipidomeR' helps you gain an immediate
    understanding of the multivariate patterns in the lipidome already at first glance.
    You can create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistical associations, changes, differences,
    variation, or other lipid-specific values. The heatmaps are provided with publication-ready
    quality and the results behind the visualizations are based on rigorous statistical
    models.
