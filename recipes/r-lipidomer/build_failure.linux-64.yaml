    summary: Create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistics with the 'lipidomeR'. The 'lipidomeR'
      provides a streamlined pipeline for the systematic interpretation of the lipidome
      through publication-ready visualizations of regression models fitted on lipidomics
      data. With 'lipidomeR', associations between covariates and the lipidome can be
      interpreted systematically and intuitively through heatmaps, where lipids are
      categorized by the lipid class and are presented on two-dimensional maps organized
      by the lipid size and level of saturation. This way, the 'lipidomeR' helps you
      gain an immediate understanding of the multivariate patterns in the lipidome already
      at first glance. You can create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistical associations,
      changes, differences, variation, or other lipid-specific values. The heatmaps
      are provided with publication-ready quality and the results behind the visualizations
      are based on rigorous statistical models.
