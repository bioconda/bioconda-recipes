  summary: e-PCR identifies sequence tagged sites(STSs) within DNA sequences.
  description: |
    Electronic PCR (e-PCR) was developed by Gregory D. Schuler at the
    NCBI, described in https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.7.5.541 Schuler (1997).
    The NCBI retired and withdrew e-PCR on 2017-06-28, suggesting the
    online-only tool Primer-BLAST instead. However, this is not suitable
    for offline high throughput usage. See also Jim Kent's isPCR (also
    available in BioConda).
