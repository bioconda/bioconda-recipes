  license: GPL-3
  summary: Given a phylogenetic tree T and an assemblage S of species represented as  a subset
    of tips in T, we want to compute a measure of the diversity  of the species in S
    with respect to T. The current package offers  efficient algorithms that can process
    large phylogenetic data for several such measures.  Most importantly, the package
    includes algorithms for computing  efficiently the standardized versions of phylogenetic
    measures and their p-values, which are  essential for null model comparisons. Among
    other functions,  the package provides efficient computation of richness-standardized
    versions  for indices such as the net relatedness index (NRI),  nearest taxon index
    (NTI), phylogenetic diversity index (PDI), and the corresponding indices of two-sample
    measures.  The package also introduces a new single-sample measure, the Core Ancestor
    Cost (CAC); the package provides functions for computing the value and the standardised
    index of the CAC and, more than that, there is an extra function available that
    can compute exactly  any statistical moment of the measure. The package supports
    computations under different null models, including abundance-weighted models.
