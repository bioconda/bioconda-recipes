  summary: A java tool to map peptide and peptidoform evideces to ENSEMBL Genome Coordinates

extra:
  notes: |-
    PepGenome is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "PepGenome -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
