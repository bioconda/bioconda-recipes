  summary: A coalescent simulator that allows the rapid simulation of biological sequences under
    neutral models of evolution. Different to other coalescent based simulations, it
    has an optional approximation parameter that allows for high accuracy while maintaining
    a linear run time cost for long sequences. It is optimized for simulating massive
    data sets as produced by Next-Generation Sequencing technologies for up to several
    thousand sequences.
