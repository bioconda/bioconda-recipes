  summary: The central goal of XGR by Fang et al. (2016) <doi:10.1186/s13073-016-0384-y> is to
    provide a data interpretation system necessary to do "big data" science. It is designed
    to make a user-defined gene or SNP list (or genomic regions) more interpretable
    by comprehensively utilising ontology annotations and interaction networks to reveal
    relationships and enhance opportunities for biological discovery. XGR is unique
    in supporting a broad range of ontologies (including knowledge of biological and
    molecular functions, pathways, diseases and phenotypes - in both human and mouse)
    and different types of networks (including functional, physical and pathway interactions).
    There are two core functionalities of XGR. The first is to provide basic infrastructures
    for easy access to built-in ontologies and networks. The second is to support data
    interpretations via 1) enrichment analysis using either built-in or custom ontologies,
    2) similarity analysis for calculating semantic similarity between genes (or SNPs)
    based on their ontology annotation profiles, 3) network analysis for identification
    of gene networks given a query list of (significant) genes, SNPs or genomic regions,
    and 4) annotation analysis for interpreting genomic regions using co-localised functional
    genomic annotations (such as open chromatin, epigenetic marks, TF binding sites
    and genomic segments) and using nearby gene annotations (by ontologies). Together
    with its web app, XGR aims to provide a user-friendly tool for exploring genomic
    relations at the gene, SNP and genomic region level.
