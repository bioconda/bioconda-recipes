  summary: 'RNA structure prediction algorithm improved through crowdsourced training data'
  description: |
    EternaFold performs multitask learning to improve RNA structure prediction. 
    Its training tasks include 1) predicting single structures, 2) maximizing the 
    likelihood of structure probing data, and 3) predicting experimentally-measured 
    affinities of RNA molecules to proteins and small molecules. Described in the paper
