  summary: This package contains various routines for drawing ellipses and ellipse-like confidence
    regions, implementing the plots described in Murdoch and Chow (1996), A graphical
    display of large correlation matrices, The American Statistician 50, 178-180. There
    are also routines implementing the profile plots described in Bates and Watts (1988),
    Nonlinear Regression Analysis and its Applications.
