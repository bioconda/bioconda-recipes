  summary: LearnBayes contains a collection of functions helpful in learning the basic tenets
    of Bayesian statistical inference.  It contains functions for summarizing basic
    one and two parameter posterior distributions and predictive distributions.  It
    contains MCMC algorithms for summarizing posterior distributions defined by the
    user.  It also contains functions for regression models, hierarchical models, Bayesian
    tests, and illustrations of Gibbs sampling.
