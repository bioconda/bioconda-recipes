  configure: error: liblzma development files not found

  The CRAM format may use LZMA2 compression, which is implemented in HTSlib
  by using compression routines from liblzma <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.
  Linking HTSlib requires liblzma development files to be installed on the
  build machine; you may need to ensure a package such as liblzma-dev (on Debian
  or Ubuntu Linux), xz-devel (on RPM-based Linux distributions or Cygwin), or
  xz (via Homebrew on macOS) is installed; or build XZ Utils from source.

  FAILED.  Please resolve this error to build cellsnp-lite.
