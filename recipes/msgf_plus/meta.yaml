  summary: MS-GF+ is a MS/MS database search tool
  description: |
    MS-GF+ is a MS/MS database search tool that is sensitive (it identifies more
    peptides than other database search tools and as many peptides as spectral
    library search tools) and universal (works well for diverse types of
    spectra, different configurations of MS instruments and different
    experimental protocols).
