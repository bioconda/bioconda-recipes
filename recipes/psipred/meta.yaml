  summary: "Protein Secondary Structure Predictor"
  description: |
    PSIPRED is a  simple and accurate secondary structure prediction method, incorporating two feed-forward neural networks which perform an analysis on output obtained from
    [PSI-BLAST](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) (Position Specific Iterated - BLAST).
    Using a very stringent cross validation method to evaluate the method's performance, PSIPRED 3.2 achieves an average Q3 score of 81.6%.
    Predictions produced by PSIPRED were also submitted to the [CASP4](http://predictioncenter.llnl.gov/casp4/) evaluation and assessed during the CASP4 meeting, which took place in December 2000 at Asilomar.
    PSIPRED 2.0 achieved an average Q3 score of 80.6% across all 40 submitted target domains with no obvious sequence similarity to structures present in PDB, which ranked PSIPRED top out of 20 evaluated methods
    (an earlier version of PSIPRED was also ranked top in CASP3 held in 1998).
    It is important to realise, however, that due to the small sample sizes, the results from CASP are not statistically significant, although they do give a rough guide as to the current "state of the art".
    For a more reliable evaluation, the [EVA](http://pdg.cnb.uam.es/eva/) web site at Columbia University provides a continuous evaluation. NOTE that at the time of writing, the EVA site is no longer being updated.
