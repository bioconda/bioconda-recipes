  summary: >
    Meraculous is a whole genome assembler for Next Generation Sequencing data, geared for large genomes.
    It's hybrid k-mer/read-based approach capitalizes on the high accuracy of Illumina sequence by eschewing an
    explicit error correction step which we argue to be redundant with the assembly process. Meraculous achieves
    high performance with large datasets by utilizing lightweight data structures and multi-threaded
    parallelization, allowing to assemble human-sized genomes on a high-cpu cluster in under a day. The process
    pipeline implements a highly transparent and portable model of job control and monitoring where different
    assembly stages can be executed and re-executed separately or in unison on a wide variety of architectures.
