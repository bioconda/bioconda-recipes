  summary: Compute the count of cases in constant sites in a (FASTA) multiple sequence alignment
  description: |
    Given a FASTA file with a multiple sequence alignment of nucleotides,
    this tool counts the sites in the alignment that are constant. The 
    output is a line suitable for use in IQTREE's `-fconst`, thus 4 numbers
    with commas expressing the count of As, Cs, Gs and Ts.
