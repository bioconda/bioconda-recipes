  summary: 'Toolkit for experimental design and demultiplexing genotyping by sequencing experiments'
  description: |
    Genotyping By Sequencing demultipleXing toolkit (GBSX) is a toolkit with an
    inline barcode demultiplexer for usage in the analysis of single read or
    paired-end genotyping by sequence (GBS) data, a barcode generator, a barcode
    discovery tool, and a restriction enzyme predictor. GBSX can easily be
    incorperated as a preceding analysis step for already deployed SNP pipelines.

  notes: |
    GBSX is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "gbsx" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "gbsx -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
