  summary: "An implementation of the homo-edit distance algorithm."
  description: "A homo-insertion is an insertion of a string of equal characters, which we also call a block, into another string. A homo-deletion is the inverse operation, that is, the deletion of such a block. We consider the following problem: Given two strings, what is the minimum number of homo-insertions or homo-deletions needed to convert one into the other? We refer to this number as the homo-edit distance."
