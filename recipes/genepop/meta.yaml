# After talking with the author, we decided that, for existing genepop
# versions, we would take the out from the exinsting R packages.
# So, the R package is 1.2.2 but Genepop is 4.8.2. People do not really know
# the R package version. In the future (hopefully) a standalone version of
# genepop will be provided (actually it is provided and always was, but
# the author did not kept old versions, just replaced the source code zip).
# All this kerfufle is just to make sure we are able to maintain exact
# versions (reproducibility and all).
