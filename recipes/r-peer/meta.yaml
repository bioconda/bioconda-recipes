  summary: 'PEER is a collection of Bayesian approaches to infer hidden 
determinants and their effects from gene expression profiles using factor 
analysis methods. Applications of PEER have (i) detected batch effects and 
experimental confounders (ii) increased the number of expression QTL findings 
by threefold and (iii) allowed inference of intermediate cellular traits, such 
as transcription factor or pathway activations. This project offers an 
efficient and versatile C++ implementation of the underlying algorithms with 
user-friendly interfaces to R and python. '
