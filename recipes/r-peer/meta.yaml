  summary: 'PEER is a collection of Bayesian approaches to infer hidden
determinants and their effects from gene expression profiles using factor
analysis methods. Applications of PEER have (i) detected batch effects and
experimental confounders (ii) increased the number of expression QTL findings
by threefold and (iii) allowed inference of intermediate cellular traits, such
as transcription factor or pathway activations. This project offers an
efficient and versatile C++ implementation of the underlying algorithms with
user-friendly interfaces to R and python. '
