  summary: MetaCluster5.1 is a new software for binning short pair-end reads
  description: |
    MetaCluster5.1 is an unsupervised binning method that can (1) samples with
    low-abundance species, or (2) samples (even with high-abundance) with many
    extremely-low-abundance species. The input file should be in fasta format.
    Every odd-number read and its next read are supposed to be pair-end reads.
