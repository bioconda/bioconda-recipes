  summary: 'Provides high level functions for reading Affy .CEL files, phenotypic
    data, and then computing simple things with it, such as t-tests, fold changes
    and the like. Makes heavy use of the affy library. Also has some basic scatter
    plot functions and mechanisms for generating high resolution journal figures...'
