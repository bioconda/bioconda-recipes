  notes: |
    QoRTs is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "qorts" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "qorts -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
