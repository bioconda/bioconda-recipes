  summary: 'Nanopore RNA-Seq Example data'
  description: 'The NanoporeRNASeq package contains long read RNA-Seq data generated using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing. The data consists of 6 samples from two human cell lines (K562 and MCF7) that were generated by the SG-NEx project. Each of these cell lines has three replicates, with 1 direct RNA sequencing data and 2 cDNA sequencing data. Reads are aligned to chromosome 22 (Grch38) and stored as bam files. The original data is from the SG-NEx project.'
