  summary: Bedtk is a set of simple tools to process BED files.
  description: >
    Bedtk is a set of simple tools to process BED files.
    It so far implements intersection, subtraction, sorting, merging and computing the breadth of coverage.
    Bedtk is not as versatile as bedtools and never aims to match the bedtools feature set.
    It instead focuses on performance.
    Bedtk is several to tens of times faster and uses a fraction of memory.
    It also provides a few convenient functions.
    For example, sorting, merging and intersection can be done in one go without Unix pipes.
