  summary: 'UniProt Id Mapping through API'
  description: |
    UPIMAPI takes as input either a list of UniProt IDs or a blast file from
    annotation using UniProt database as reference and uses UniProt's API to
    retrieve information relative to those IDs. It is essentially a command
    line implementation of UniProt's ID mapping web service available at
    https://www.uniprot.org/uploadlists/, allowing for retrieval of information
    from thousands of IDs in one go, while still relying on the web service.
