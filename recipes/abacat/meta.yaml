  summary: 'abacat'
  description: |
    Abacat (pronounced "ABBA-cat") is a toolkit for working with bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. 
    It provides Python objects to represent elements which are common to WGS analysis workflows, 
    such as coding sequence (CDS) files, containing genes or proteins, alignment methods, or statistics about your sequences.
    It can be used to annotate freshly generated WGS data and parse existing, curated NCBI data. 
    It can also index different BLAST or HMM databases for easy alignment searches and produce comparisons using Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) measurements. 
    Lastly, Abacat's classes provides means of tracking data provenance in large scale genomics experiments, in a way users can monitor and tailor their workflow accordingly.
