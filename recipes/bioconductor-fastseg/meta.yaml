  summary: 'fastseg implements a very fast and efficient segmentation algorithm. It
    has similar functionality as DNACopy (Olshen and Venkatraman 2004), but is considerably
    faster and more flexible. fastseg can segment data from DNA microarrays and data
    from next generation sequencing for example to detect copy number segments. Further
    it can segment data from RNA microarrays like tiling arrays to identify transcripts.
    Most generally, it can segment data given as a matrix or as a vector. Various
    data formats can be used as input to fastseg like expression set objects for microarrays
    or GRanges for sequencing data. The segmentation criterion of fastseg is based
    on a statistical test in a Bayesian framework, namely the cyber t-test (Baldi
    2001). The speed-up arises from the facts, that sampling is not necessary in for
    fastseg and that a dynamic programming approach is used for calculation of the
    segments'' first and higher order moments.'
