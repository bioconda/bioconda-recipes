  summary: 'Testing SNPs and SNP interactions with a genotypic TDT. This package furthermore
    contains functions for computing pairwise values of LD measures and for identifying
    LD blocks, as well as functions for setting up matched case pseudo-control genotype
    data for case-parent trios in order to run trio logic regression, for imputing
    missing genotypes in trios, for simulating case-parent trios with disease risk
    dependent on SNP interaction, and for power and sample size calculation in trio
    data.'
