  summary: 'CorMut provides functions for computing kaks for individual sites or specific
    amino acids and detecting correlated mutations among them. Three methods are provided
    for detecting correlated mutations ,including conditional selection pressure,
    mutual information and Jaccard index. The computation consists of two steps: First,
    the positive selection sites are detected; Second, the mutation correlations are
    computed among the positive selection sites. Note that the first step is optional.
    Meanwhile, CorMut facilitates the comparison of the correlated mutations between
    two conditions by the means of correlated mutation network.'
