  summary: Combine multidimensional arrays into a single array. This is a generalization of 'cbind'
    and 'rbind'.  Works with vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays.  Also
    provides functions 'adrop', 'asub', and 'afill' for manipulating, extracting and
    replacing data in arrays.
