  summary: 'This package implements gene and gene-set level analysis methods for somatic
    mutation studies of cancer.  The gene-level methods distinguish between driver
    genes (which play an active role in tumorigenesis) and passenger genes (which
    are mutated in tumor samples, but have no role in tumorigenesis) and incorporate
    a two-stage study design.  The gene-set methods implement a patient-oriented approach,
    which calculates gene-set scores for each sample, then combines them across samples;
    a gene-oriented approach which uses the Wilcoxon test is also provided for comparison.'
