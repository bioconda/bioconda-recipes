  summary: "MView extracts and reformats the results of a sequence database search or multiple alignment."
  description: |
    MView is a command line utility that extracts and reformats the results of a sequence database search or a multiple alignment,
    optionally adding HTML markup for web page layout. It can also be used as a filter to extract and convert searches or alignments to common formats.

    Inputs:
      - Sequence database search: BLAST, FASTA suites.
      - Multiple sequence alignment: CLUSTAL, HSSP, MSF, FASTA, PIR, MAF.

    Outputs:
      - HTML, FASTA, CLUSTAL, MSF, PIR, RDB (tab-separated).

    The tool is used in molecular biology and biomedical research for data analyses and as a component in various bioinformatics web services.
    Research papers citing MView are indexed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ughzM0AAAAJ&hl=en).
