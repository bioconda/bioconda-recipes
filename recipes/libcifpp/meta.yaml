  description: |
    This library, libcifpp, is a generic CIF library with some specific additions to work with mmCIF files.
    The main focus of this library is to make sure that files read or written are valid.
    That is, they are syntactically valid and their content is valid with respect to a CIF dictionary, if such a dictionary is available and specified.
