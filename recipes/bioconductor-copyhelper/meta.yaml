  summary: 'This package contains the helper files that are required to run the Bioconductor
    package CopywriteR. It contains pre-assembled 1kb bin GC-content and mappability
    files for the reference genomes hg18, hg19, hg38, mm9 and mm10. In addition, it
    contains a blacklist filter to remove regions that display CNV. Files are stored
    as GRanges objects from the GenomicRanges Bioconductor package.'
