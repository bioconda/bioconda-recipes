  summary: NCBI BLAST next generation read mapper
  description: |
    Magic-BLAST is a tool for mapping large next-generation RNA or DNA 
    sequencing runs against a whole genome or transcriptome. Each alignment
    optimizes a composite score, taking into account simultaneously the two
    reads of a pair, and in case of RNA-seq, locating the candidate introns
    and adding up the score of all exons. This is very different from other
    versions of BLAST, where each exon is scored as a separate hit and
    read-pairing is ignored.

    Magic-BLAST incorporates within the NCBI BLAST code framework ideas 
    developed in the NCBI Magic pipeline, in particular hit extensions by local 
    walk and jump (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26109056), and 
    recursive clipping of mismatches near the edges of the reads, which avoids
    accumulating artefactual mismatches near splice sites and is needed to
    distinguish short indels from substitutions near the edges.
