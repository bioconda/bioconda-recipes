  summary: 'An ExperimentHub package for accessing processed RLSuite data sets'
  description: '| RLHub provides a convenient interface to the processed data provided within RLSuite, a tool-chain for analyzing R-loop-mapping data sets. The primary purpose of RLHub is to serve the processed data sets required by the RLSeq R package and the RLBase web service. Additionally, RLHub provides a stand-alone R interface to these data, benefiting users who are addressing questions related to R-loop regions (RL-Regions), R-loop-binding proteins (RLBPs), R-loop co-localizing factors, and the differences between R-loop-mapping methods. The full data-generating protocol is found here: https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/RLBase-data.'
