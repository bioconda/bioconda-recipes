You need to install cabal and run

    cabal update

This recipe will install some dependencies into cabal, so you need to have
write access to it.

On Linux, you need to install zlib.

    sudo apt-get install libghc-zlib-dev

works on Ubuntu.

On OS X it just installs from binary so you don't need to worry about any of
this.
