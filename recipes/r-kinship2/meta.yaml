  summary: Routines to handle family data with a pedigree object. The initial purpose was to
    create correlation structures that describe  family relationships such as kinship
    and identity-by-descent, which can be used to model family data in mixed effects
    models, such as in the  coxme function.  Also includes a tool for pedigree drawing
    which is  focused on producing compact layouts without intervention.  Recent additions
    include utilities to trim the pedigree object with various criteria, and  kinship
    for the X chromosome.
