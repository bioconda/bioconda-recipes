  summary: EGACryptor v.2.0.0
  license: unknown
  description: |
    The EGACryptor v.2.0.0 is a JAVA-based application which enables submitters 
    to produce EGA compliant encrypted files along with files for the encrypted
    and unencrypted md5sum for each file to be submitted. The application will 
    generate an output folder that will by default mirror the directory structure
    containing the original files. This output folder can subsequently be uploaded
    to the EGA FTP staging area via an FTP or Aspera client.
