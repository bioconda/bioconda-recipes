  summary: "Compute first two isotopologues intensity from peptide sequence"
  description: |
    Seq-to-first-iso is a Python package that computes isotopologues M0 and M1
    of peptides with a 99.99 % 12C enrichment for quantification by SLIM-labeling.
    It simulates auxotrophies by differentiating labelled and unlabelled
    amino acids.
