  patches:
    - RunButterfly.cc.patch # this file is missing a header include

    # Adjust compilation to allow 1GB stack size
    - Chrysalis_stacksize.patch  # [osx]

    - headerpad.patch  # [osx]

extra:
  notes: "Trinity version date.2011_11_26 relies on a custom wrapper script, symlinked to bin/: Trinity-runner.sh. This script changes the current working directory to that of the Trinity.pl perl script before calling Trinity, so relative paths work as expected (particularly for Trinity plugins). All arguments are passed to Trinity.pl (via $@)"
test:
    commands:
        # This version of Trinity does not have a quick function to exit 0
        # So at least check that we can compile the file
        - "Trinity-test &> /dev/null"
