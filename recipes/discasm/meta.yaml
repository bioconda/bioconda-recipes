    # The reason for skipping osx is that trinity >=2.4 is not available in the osx channel
    # The python code in DISCASM runs on python 2.7.

requirements:

    run:
        - python
        - perl
        - star >=2.4

        # DISCASM requires the environment variable TRINITY_HOME to be set.
        # If TRINITY_HOME is not set before it starts, it uses "which" to find
        # Trinity and sets TRINITY_HOME to be the directory where Trinity resides.

    summary: "DISCASM aims to extract reads that map to reference genomes in a discordant fashion and optionally include reads that do not map to the genome at all, and perform a de novo transcriptome assembly of these reads. DISCASM relies on the output from STAR (as run via STAR-Fusion), and supports de novo transcriptome assembly using Trinity or Oases. - https://github.com/DISCASM/DISCASM/wiki"
