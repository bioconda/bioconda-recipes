  # The reason for skipping osx is that trinity >=2.4 is not available in the osx channel
  # The python code in DISCASM runs on python 2.7.

requirements:
  run:
    - python <3
    - pysam >=0.10.0
    - perl
    - star >=2.4
    - trinity >=2.4
    - oases >=0.2

    # The following commands need to be invoked from where they are located.
    # DISCASM runs them from that location. These tests invoke them that way.

  summary: "DISCASM aims to extract reads that map to reference genomes in a discordant fashion and optionally include reads that do not map to the genome at all, and perform a de novo transcriptome assembly of these reads. DISCASM relies on the output from STAR (as run via STAR-Fusion), and supports de novo transcriptome assembly using Trinity or Oases. - https://github.com/DISCASM/DISCASM/wiki"
