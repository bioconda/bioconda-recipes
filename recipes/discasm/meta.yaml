  # The reason for skipping osx is that trinity >=2.4 is not available in the osx channel
  # The python code in DISCASM runs on python 2.7.

  summary: "DISCASM aims to extract reads that map to reference genomes in a discordant fashion and optionally include reads that do not map to the genome at all, and perform a de novo transcriptome assembly of these reads. DISCASM relies on the output from STAR (as run via STAR-Fusion), and supports de novo transcriptome assembly using Trinity or Oases. - https://github.com/DISCASM/DISCASM/wiki"
