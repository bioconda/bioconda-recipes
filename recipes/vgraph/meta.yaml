  summary: 'A command line application and Python library to compare genetic variants using variant graphs.'

  description: |
    vgraph is a command line application and Python library to compare genetic variants
    using variant graphs. `vgraph` utilizes a graph representation of genomic variants in to
    precisely compare complex variants that are refractory to comparison by conventional
    comparison methods.
