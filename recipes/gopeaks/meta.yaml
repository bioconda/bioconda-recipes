  summary: 'Peak caller for CUT&TAG data'
  description: GoPeaks is a peak caller designed for CUT&TAG/CUT&RUN sequencing data. GoPeaks by default works best with narrow peaks such as H3K4me3 and transcription factors. However, broad epigenetic marks like H3K27Ac/H3K4me1 require different the step, slide, and minwidth parameters. We encourage users to explore the parameters of GoPeaks to analyze their data.
