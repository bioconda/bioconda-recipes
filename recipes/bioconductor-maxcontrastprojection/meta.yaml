  summary: 'A problem when recording 3D fluorescent microscopy images is how to properly present these results in 2D. Maximum intensity projections are a popular method to determine the focal plane of each pixel in the image. The problem with this approach, however, is that out-of-focus elements will still be visible, making edges and fine structures difficult to detect. This package aims to resolve this problem by using the contrast around a given pixel to determine the focal plane, allowing for a much cleaner structure detection than would be otherwise possible. For convenience, this package also contains functions to perform various other types of projections, including a maximum intensity projection.'
