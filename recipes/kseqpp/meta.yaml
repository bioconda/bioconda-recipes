  summary: 'C++11 re-implementation of kseq by Heng Li'
  description: |
    The goal for re-implementation of kseq is providing modern API and resource
    management while preserving its flexibility and performance. Like original
    kseq, this parser is based on generic stream buffer and works with different
    file types.
