gNALI library code has been installed, and can now be used with databases already containing loss-of-function annotations.
To use gNALI with databases without loss-of-function annotations, please use the 'gnali_get_data' command.
This will install LOFTEE within gNALI, and required files for VEP/LOFTEE.
