# To Do

# Some of the internal libraries are not built. These messages are printed during the build:

# NOTE - internal library libkff cannot be built: It requires 'libmagic' and its development headers.
# NOTE - internal library libkxml cannot be built: It requires 'libxml2' and its development headers.
# NOTE - internal library libkxfs cannot be built: It requires 'libxml2' and its development headers.
# NOTE - library libkdf5 cannot be built: It requires 'libhdf5' and its development headers.
# NOTE - library libvdb-sqlite cannot be built: It requires 'libxml2'.

# These other notes are written at configure time:

# bison: command not found
# bc: command not found
