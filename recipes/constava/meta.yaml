  summary: Calculate conformational states probability and variability from a protein structure ensemble
  description: |
    Constava analyzes conformational ensembles calculating conformational state propensities and
    conformational state variability. The conformational state propensities indicate the likelihood
    of a residue residing in a given conformational state, while the conformational state variability
    is a measure of the residues ability to transition between conformational states.

    Each conformational state is a statistical model of based on the backbone dihedrals (phi, psi). The
    default models were derived from an analysis of NMR ensembles and chemical shifts. To analyze a
    conformational ensemble, the phi- and psi-angles for each conformational state in the ensemble
    need to be provided.

    As input data Constava needs the backbone dihedral angles extracted from the conformational ensemble.
    These dihedrals can be obtained using GROMACS' gmx chi module (set `--input-format=xvg`)
    or using the constava dihedrals submodule, which supports a wide range of MD and structure formats.

    The software is subdivided in three submodules:

    The constava dihedrals submodule provides a simple way to extract backbone dihedral angles from MD
    simulations or PDB ensembles. For more information run: `constava dihedrals -h`. Alternatively,
    the backbone dihedrals may be extracted with GROMACS' gmx chi module.

    The constava analyze submodule analyzes the provided backbone dihedral angles and infers
    the propensities for each residue to reside in a given conformational state. For more information run:
    `constava analyze -h`.

    The constava fit-model can be used to train a custom probabilistic model of conformational states. The
    default models were derived from an analysis of NMR ensembles and chemical shifts; they cover six
    conformational states:

    1. Core Helix - Exclusively alpha-helical, low backbone dynamics
    2. Surrounding Helix - Mostly alpha-helical, high backbone dynamics
    3. Core Sheet - Exclusively beta-sheet, low backbone dynamics
    4. Surrounding Sheet - Mostly extended conformation, high backbone dynamics
    5. Turn - Mostly turn, high backbone dynamics
    6. Other - Mostly coil, high backbone dynamics

    For more information run: `constava fit-model -h`.
