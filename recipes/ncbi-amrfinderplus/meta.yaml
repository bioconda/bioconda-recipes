  summary: AMRFinderPlus finds antimicrobial resistance and other genes in protein or nucleotide sequences.
  description: |
      This software and the accompanying database are designed to
      find acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in bacterial protein or
      nucleotide sequences as well as known point mutations for several taxa. With
      AMRFinderPlus we have added select members of additional classes of genes
      such as virulence factors, biocide, heat, acid, and metal resistance genes.
