  summary: 'Provides Bayesian PCA, Probabilistic PCA, Nipals PCA, Inverse Non-Linear
    PCA and the conventional SVD PCA. A cluster based method for missing value estimation
    is included for comparison. BPCA, PPCA and NipalsPCA may be used to perform PCA
    on incomplete data as well as for accurate missing value estimation. A set of
    methods for printing and plotting the results is also provided. All PCA methods
    make use of the same data structure (pcaRes) to provide a common interface to
    the PCA results. Initiated at the Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology,
    Golm, Germany.'
