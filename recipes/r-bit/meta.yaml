  summary: 'bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs),  coercion from and to logicals, integers
    and integer subscripts;  fast boolean operators and fast summary statistics.  With
    ''bit'' vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the  expense
    of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less  RAM and ~ factor
    32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of  R calls, actual speed gain
    depends on the size of the vector: expect gains  for vectors of size > 10000 elements.
    Even for one-time boolean operations  it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off
    is obvious, when such  components are used more than once.  Reading from and writing
    to bit is approximately as fast as accessing  standard logicals - mostly due to
    R''s time for memory allocation. The package  allows to work with pre-allocated
    memory for return values by calling .Call()  directly: when evaluating the speed
    of C-access with pre-allocated vector  memory, coping from bit to logical requires
    only 70% of the time for copying  from logical to logical; and copying from logical
    to bit comes at a  performance penalty of 150%. the package now contains further
    classes for  representing logical selections: ''bitwhich'' for very skewed selections
    and  ''ri'' for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing. All three index  classes
    can be used for subsetting ''ff'' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).'
