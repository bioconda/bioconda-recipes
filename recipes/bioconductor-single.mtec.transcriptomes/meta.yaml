  summary: 'This data package contains the code used to analyse the single-cell RNA-seq and the bulk ATAC-seq data from the manuscript titled: Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals coordinated ectopic-gene expression patterns in medullary thymic epithelial cells. This paper was published in Nature Immunology 16,933-941(2015). The data objects provided in this package has been pre-processed: the raw data files can be downloaded from ArrayExpress under the accession identifiers E-MTAB-3346 and E-MTAB-3624. The vignette of this data package provides a documented and reproducible workflow that includes the code that was used to generate each statistic and figure from the manuscript.'
