  summary: 'The Mergeomics pipeline serves as a flexible framework for integrating
    multidimensional omics-disease associations, functional genomics,  canonical pathways
    and gene-gene interaction networks to generate mechanistic hypotheses. It includes
    two main parts, 1) Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA); 2) Weighted Key Driver
    Analysis (wKDA).'
