  summary: Bayesian analysis of allele specific expression
  description: 'Allelic imbalance (AI) occurs when alleles in a diploid individual are
  differentially expressed and indicates cis acting regulatory variation. What is the distribution
  of allelic effects in a natural population? Are all alleles the same? Are all alleles distinct?
  Tests of allelic effect are performed by crossing individuals and comparing expression between
  alleles directly in the F1. However, a crossing scheme that compares alleles pairwise is a
  prohibitive cost for more than a handful of alleles as the number of crosses is at least (n2-n)/2
  where n is the number of alleles. We show here that a testcross design followed by a hypothesis
  test of AI between testcrosses can be used to infer differences between non-tester alleles,
  allowing n alleles to be compared with n crosses. Using a mouse dataset where both testcrosses
  and direct comparisons have been performed, we show that ~75% of the predicted differences
  between non-tester alleles are validated in a background of ~10% differences in AI. The testing
  for AI involves several complex bioinformatics steps. BASE is a complete bioinformatics pipeline
  that incorporates state-of-the-art error reduction techniques and a flexible Bayesian approach to
  estimating AI and formally comparing levels of AI between conditions. In the mouse data, the
  direct test identifies more cis effects than the testcross. Cis-by-trans interactions with
  trans-acting factors on the X contributing to observed cis effects in autosomal genes in the
  direct cross remains a possible explanation for the discrepancy.'
