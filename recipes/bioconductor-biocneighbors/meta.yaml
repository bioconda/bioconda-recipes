  summary: 'Implements exact and approximate methods for nearest neighbor detection, in a framework that allows them to be easily switched within Bioconductor packages or workflows. The exact algorithm is implemented using pre-clustering with the k-means algorithm, as described by Wang (2012). This is faster than conventional kd-trees for neighbor searching in higher (> 20) dimensional data. The approximate method uses the Annoy algorithm. Functions are also provided to search for all neighbors within a given distance. Parallelization is achieved for all methods using the BiocParallel framework.'
