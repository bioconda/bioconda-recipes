  notes: |
    npinv is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper python script which I took from peptide-shaker.
    By default "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "npinv -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
