  summary: MIRfix automatically curates miRNA datasets by improving alignments of their precursors, the consistency of the annotation of mature miR and miR* sequence, and the phylogenetic coverage. MIRfix produces alignments that are comparable across families and sets the stage for improved homology search as well as quantitative analyses.
