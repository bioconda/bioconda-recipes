  summary: 'A tool for representing genomic potential and transcriptomic expression into KEGG pathways'
  description: |
    KEGGCharter takes as input a quantification table of proteins with corresponding
    KEGG IDs available and maps that information into KEGG metabolic maps using 
    the KEGG API. Both genomic potential (from either genomics or metagenomics)
    and gene expression quantification (from either (meta)transcriptomics or
    (meta)proteomics) can be represented. Genomic information is mapped in a binary
    exists or not rule, for each taxon available KEGGCharter will assign a color
    which will be included in the boxes corresponding to functions present in that
    taxon. Gene expression quantification is mapped as differential expression
    where quantification between the several columns specified is represented as
    a single row heatmap for each function present in the data.
