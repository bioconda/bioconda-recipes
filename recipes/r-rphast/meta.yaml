  summary: Provides an R interface to the 'PHAST'(<http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/>) software
    (Phylogenetic Analysis with Space/Time Models).  It can be used for many types of
    analysis in comparative and evolutionary genomics, such as estimating models of
    evolution from sequence data, scoring alignments for conservation or acceleration,
    and predicting elements based on conservation or custom phylogenetic hidden Markov
    models.  It can also perform many basic operations on multiple sequence alignments
    and phylogenetic trees.
