  summary: 'A simple and flexible way to generate Circos 2D track plot images for genomic data
    visualization is implemented in this package. The types of plots include: heatmap,
    histogram, lines, scatterplot, tiles and plot items for further decorations include
    connector, link (lines and ribbons), and text (gene) label. All functions require
    only R graphics package that comes with R base installation.  '
