  summary: Online data collection tools like Google Forms often export multiple-response questions
    with data concatenated in cells. The concat.split (cSplit) family of functions splits
    such data into  separate cells. The package also includes functions to stack groups  of
    columns and to reshape wide data, even when the data are  "unbalanced"---something
    which reshape (from base R) does not handle,  and which melt and dcast from reshape2
    do not easily handle.
