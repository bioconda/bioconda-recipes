  summary: 'This package allows users to control the false discovery rate for online hypothesis testing, where hypotheses arrive sequentially in a stream, as presented by Javanmard and Montanari (2015, 2018) and Ramdas et al. (2017). In this framework, a null hypothesis is rejected based only on the previous decisions, as the future p-values and the number of hypotheses to be tested are unknown.'
