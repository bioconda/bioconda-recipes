  summary: Efficient likelihood calculations to place samples into a phylogenetic tree.
  description: |
    Efficient likelihood calculations to place samples into a phylogenetic tree. 
    In particular, phynder was originally designed for placing male ancient DNA 
    samples into the Y chromosome phylogeny, when there are arbitrarily high rates 
    of missing data. It has also been used for assigning ancient samples to whole 
    mitochondrial genome phylogenies.
