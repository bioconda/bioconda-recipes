  summary: 'The package contains a collection of functions for left-censored missing data imputation.
    Left-censoring is a special case of missing not at random (MNAR)  mechanism that
    generates non-responses in proteomics experiments. The package also contains functions
    to artificially generate peptide/protein expression data (log-transformed) as random
    draws from a multivariate Gaussian distribution as well as a function to generate
    missing data (both randomly and non-randomly). For comparison reasons, the package
    also contains several wrapper functions for the imputation of non-responses that
    are missing at random. * New functionality has been added: a hybrid method that
    allows the imputation of missing values in a more complex scenario where the missing
    data are both MAR and MNAR.'
