  summary: >-
    Vidjil-algo processes high-throughput sequencing data to extract V(D)J
    junctions and gather them into clones. Vidjil-algo starts
    from a set of reads and detects "windows" overlapping the actual CDR3.
    This is based on an fast and reliable seed-based heuristic and allows
    to output all sequenced clones. The analysis is extremely fast
    because, in the first phase, no alignment is performed with database
    germline sequences.
