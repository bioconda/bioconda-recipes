  summary: 'ChromHMM is software for learning and characterizing chromatin states. ChromHMM can integrate multiple chromatin datasets such as ChIP-seq data of various histone modifications to discover de novo the major re-occuring combinatorial and spatial patterns of marks.'

extra:
  notes: 'ChromHMM comes with about 36MB of example data which is not included in the recipe. This recipe installs a script, "download_chromhmm_data.sh", which downloads the data in the proper location, and which can be run after ChromHMM has been installed.'
