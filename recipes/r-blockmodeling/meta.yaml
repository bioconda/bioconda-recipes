  summary: The package is primarly ment as an implementation of Generalized blockmodeling for
    valued networks. In addition, measurese of similarity or dissimilarity based on
    structural equivalence and regular equivalence (REGE algorithem) can be computed
    and partitioned matrices can be ploted.
