  skip-lints:
    # below is copied from recipes/d4tools: (clam uses the d4 crate as a dependency, not the conda package d4tools)
    # Because the Rust build script in rust crate will build all the upstream dependencies and those dependencies contains make file that directly call gcc rather than use $(CC) variable. Thus not forcing install gcc into the environment can cause linking error as the conda system have it's own libc.
