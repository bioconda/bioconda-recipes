  summary: Software of Inference of Quasispecies subjected to Recombination
  description: |
    QuasiRecomb presents a jumping hidden Markov model that describes the generation of the viral quasispecies and a method to infer its parameters by analysing next generation sequencing data. It offers an implementation of the EM algorithm to find maximum a posteriori estimates of the model parameters and a method to estimate the distribution of viral strains in the quasispecies.
