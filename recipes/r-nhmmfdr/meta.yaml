  summary: 'The NHMMfdr package implements the non-homogeneous 
          Hidden Markov Model based FDR control as described in Kuan et al., 2011 
          for multiple comparison adjustment under dependence. It allows for prior
          information to be incorporated in the model to improve detection of significant 
          tests.'
