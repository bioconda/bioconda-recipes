  summary: Usability wrapper around snow for easier development of parallel R programs. This
    package offers e.g. extended error checks, and additional functions. All functions
    work in sequential mode, too, if no cluster is present or wished. Package is also
    designed as connector to the cluster management tool sfCluster, but can also used
    without it.
