  summary: Functions to allow you to easily pass command-line arguments into R, and functions
    to aid in submitting your R code in parallel on a cluster and joining the results
    afterward (e.g. multiple parameter values for simulations running in parallel, splitting
    up a permutation test in parallel, etc.). See ``parseCommandArgs(...)`` for the main
    example of how to use this package.
