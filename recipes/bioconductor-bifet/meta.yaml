  summary: 'Bias-free Footprint Enrichment Test'
  description: 'BiFET identifies TFs whose footprints are over-represented in target regions compared to background regions after correcting for the bias arising from the imbalance in read counts and GC contents between the target and background regions. For a given TF k, BiFET tests the null hypothesis that the target regions have the same probability of having footprints for the TF k as the background regions while correcting for the read count and GC content bias. For this, we use the number of target regions with footprints for TF k, t_k as a test statistic and calculate the p-value as the probability of observing t_k or more target regions with footprints under the null hypothesis.'
