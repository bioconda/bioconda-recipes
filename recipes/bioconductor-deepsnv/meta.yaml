  summary: 'This package provides provides quantitative variant callers for detecting
    subclonal mutations in ultra-deep (>=100x coverage) sequencing experiments. The
    deepSNV algorithm is used for a comparative setup with a control experiment of
    the same loci and uses a beta-binomial model and a likelihood ratio test to discriminate
    sequencing errors and subclonal SNVs. The shearwater algorithm computes a Bayes
    classifier based on a beta-binomial model for variant calling with multiple samples
    for precisely estimating model parameters such as local error rates and dispersion
    and prior knowledge, e.g. from variation data bases such as COSMIC.'
