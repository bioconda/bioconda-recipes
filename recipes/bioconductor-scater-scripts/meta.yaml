  summary: A set of wrappers for individual components of the Scater package.
      Functions R packages are hard to call when building workflows outside of R,
      so this package adds a set of simple wrappers with robust argument parsing.
      Intermediate steps are currently mainly serialized R objects, but the
      ultimate objective is to have language-agnostic intermediate formats allowing
      composite workflows using a variety of software packages.
