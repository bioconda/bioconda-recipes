  summary: PathRacer is a tool for alignment of profile HMM against assembly graph.
  description: |
    PathRacer is a novel standalone tool that aligns profile HMM directly to the assembly graph (performing the codon translation on fly for amino acid 
    pHMMs). The tool provides the set of most probable paths traversed by a HMM through the whole assembly graph, regardless whether the sequence of 
    interested is encoded on the single contig or scattered across the set of edges, therefore significantly improving the recovery of sequences of 
    interest even from fragmented metagenome assemblies.
