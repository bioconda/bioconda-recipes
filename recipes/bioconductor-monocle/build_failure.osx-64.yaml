  The following packages are incompatible
   bioconductor-biocviews >=1.74.0,<1.75.0  is not installable because it requires

     r-base >=4.4,<4.5.0a0 , which can be installed;
   r-leidenbase >=0.1.9  is not installable because there are no viable options
      r-leidenbase 0.1.12 would require

      r-leidenbase [0.1.18|0.1.27] would require
