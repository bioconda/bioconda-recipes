  summary: 'Collection Of Human And Mouse TF Regulons'
  description: 'This package contains human and mouse TF regulons. The human regulons were curated and collected from different types of evidence such as literature curated resources, ChIP-seq peaks, TF binding site motifs and interactions inferred directly from gene expression. The mouse regulons were constructed by mapping the human gene symbols to their orthologs in mice. Those regulons can be coupled with any statistical method that aims to analyse gene sets to infer TF activity from gene expression data. Preferably the statistical method viper is used.'
