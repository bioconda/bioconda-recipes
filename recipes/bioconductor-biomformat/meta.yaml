  summary: 'This is an R package for interfacing with the BIOM format. This package
    includes basic tools for reading biom-format files, accessing and subsetting data
    tables from a biom object (which is more complex than a single table), as well
    as limited support for writing a biom-object back to a biom-format file. The design
    of this API is intended to match the python API and other tools included with
    the biom-format project, but with a decidedly "R flavor" that should be familiar
    to R users. This includes S4 classes and methods, as well as extensions of common
    core functions/methods.'
