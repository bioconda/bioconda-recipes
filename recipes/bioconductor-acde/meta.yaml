  summary: 'This package provides a multivariate inferential analysis method for detecting
    differentially expressed genes in gene expression data. It uses artificial components,
    close to the data''s principal components but with an exact interpretation in
    terms of differential genetic expression, to identify differentially expressed
    genes while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). The methods on this package
    are described in the vignette or in the article ''Multivariate Method for Inferential
    Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in Gene Expression Experiments''
    by J. P. Acosta, L. Lopez-Kleine and S. Restrepo (2015, pending publication).'
