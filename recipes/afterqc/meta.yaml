  summary: 'Automatic Filtering, Trimming, Error Removing and Quality Control for
    fastq data. AfterQC can simply go through all fastq files in a folder and then
    output three folders: good, bad and QC folders, which contains good reads, bad
    reads and the QC results of each fastq file/pair. Currently it supports processing
    data from HiSeq 2000/2500/3000/4000, Nextseq 500/550, MiniSeq...and other Illumina
    1.8 or newer formats.'
