  # patch: - comment tests with missing data
  # - bugfix in cfm-code/EM.cpp (cerr -> endl)
  # - fix for tools that try to access ISOTOPE.DAT or the tests folder at the working 
  #   dir (prepend $CFM_OUTPUT_DIR with the help of macros)

# - real tests currently only for fraggraph-gen and the test binary
# - other binaries need to much memory with the available test data which is most likely the 
#   reason for the failing bioconda CI tests 
# - current test files are taken from https://sourceforge.net/p/cfm-id/code/HEAD/tree/supplementary_material/cfm-train_example/train_example/
#   The MPI test would probably need configuration on the bioconda side to run. Currently fails with: 
# `PID_nem_tcp_init(379).............: gethostbyname failed, static.162.252.209.104.cyberlynk.net (errno 1)`
