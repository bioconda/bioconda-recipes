  summary: A wide range of functions for phylogenetic analysis. Functionality is concentrated
    in phylogenetic comparative biology, but also includes a diverse array of methods
    for visualizing, manipulating, reading or writing, and even inferring phylogenetic
    trees and data. Included among the functions in phylogenetic comparative biology
    are various for ancestral state reconstruction, model-fitting, simulation of phylogenies
    and data, and multivariate analysis. There are a broad range of plotting methods
    for phylogenies and comparative data which include, but are not restricted to, methods
    for mapping trait evolution on trees, for projecting trees into phenotypic space
    or a geographic map, and for visualizing correlated speciation between trees. Finally,
    there are a number of functions for reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating,
    and manipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data not covered by other packages.
    For instance, there are functions for randomly or non-randomly attaching species
    or clades to a phylogeny, for estimating supertrees or consensus phylogenies from
    a set, for simulating trees and phylogenetic data under a range of models, and for
    a wide variety of other manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists
    might find useful in their research.
