  summary: 'Independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) is a multiple testing procedure
    that increases power compared to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg by assigning
    data-driven weights to each hypothesis. The input to IHW is a two-column table
    of p-values and covariates. The covariate can be any continuous-valued or categorical
    variable that is thought to be informative on the statistical properties of each
    hypothesis test, while it is independent of the p-value under the null hypothesis.'
