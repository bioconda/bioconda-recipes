  summary: Simulation methods for phylogenetic trees where (i) all tips are sampled at one time
    point or (ii) tips are sampled sequentially through time. (i) For sampling at one
    time point, simulations are performed under a constant rate birth-death process,
    conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa()), or a fixed age
    (sim.bd.age()), or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age()). When conditioning
    on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction
    events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age()
    (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change
    in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using
    LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees
    with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm
    stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This
    latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models
    (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing
    speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa()
    is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are
    conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a
    multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of
    tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa(). This function further allows
    to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class. The function sim.genespeciestree()
    simulates coalescent gene trees within birth-death species trees, and sim.genetree()
    simulates coalescent gene trees.
