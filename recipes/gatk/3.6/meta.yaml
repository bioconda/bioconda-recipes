  notes: Due to license restrictions, this recipe cannot distribute and install GATK v3 directly. To fully install GATK, you must download a licensed copy of GATK from the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/archive), install this package, and call "gatk3-register /path/to/GenomeAnalysisTK[-$PKG_VERSION.tar.bz2|.jar]", which will copy GATK into your conda environment. The main run script has been renamed to "gatk3" to allow compatibility with the new GATK 4 launch script (which is now "gatk").
