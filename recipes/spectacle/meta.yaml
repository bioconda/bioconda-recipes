  summary: 'This software implements a spectral learning algorithm for hidden Markov models for epigenomic data. Please see our paper for further details: Song, J and Chen, K. C.

extra:
  notes: 'The Spectacle github repo weighs in at around 500MB, a large portion of which is data files. These have been removed from the conda recipe, but a script (download_spectacle_data.sh) has been included here which will download those files from github.  In addition, a wrapper script `Spectacle.sh` has been included in this recipe and should be used when calling the program.'
