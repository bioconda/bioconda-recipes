  summary: 'This software implements a spectral learning algorithm for hidden Markov
    models for epigenomic data. Please see our paper for further details: Song, J
    and Chen, K. C. Spectacle: fast chromatin state annotation using spectral learning.

extra:
  notes: The Spectacle github repo weighs in at around 500MB, a large portion of which
    is data files. These have been removed from the conda recipe, but a script (download_spectacle_data.sh)
    has been included here which will download those files from github.  In addition,
    a wrapper script `Spectacle.sh` has been included in this recipe and should be
    used when calling the program.
