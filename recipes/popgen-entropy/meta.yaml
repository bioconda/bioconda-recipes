  summary: "This program is for inferring population structure from autopolyploid and mixed-ploidy individuals, similar to structure, but using genotype-likelihood data for low- to medium-coverage sequencing depth."
  description: "entropy performs model-based genotype and ancestry estimation software for detecting hybridization in mixed-ploidy species. Information about the  model and testing can be found in the pre-print at . The vignette_entropy.pdf file in the Bitbucket repo contains instructions on how to process and analyze genomic data."
