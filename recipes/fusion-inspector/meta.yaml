build:
  number: 0
  skip: true  # [osx or py3k]
  # The reason for skipping osx is that trinity >=2.4 is not available in the osx channel
  # The python code in FusionInspector runs on python 2.7.

# Trinity is needed for the build, because we have to set its location in an environment variable.
# We need HTSLIB >=1.3, but was complaining about unpinned. CONDA_HTSLIB is 1.6.
