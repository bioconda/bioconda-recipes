  summary: This is a stand-alone implementation of the new updated PRIDE Cluster algorithm.
    It is based on the spectra-cluster API and uses a highly similar logic as the
    Hadoop implementation spectra-cluster-hadoop used to build the PRIDE Cluster resource.

extra:
  notes: |-
    spectra-cluster-cli is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "spectra-cluster-cli -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
