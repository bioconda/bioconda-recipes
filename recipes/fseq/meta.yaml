# Both fseq and mapviewToBed return nonzero exit status unless you actually run them
# The grep call is added to make sure that the wrapper works correctly. If a java argument is
# incorrect, you get java usage rather than fseq usage. We want to make sure that we get the latter
# not the former.
# The reason for extra quotes around 'bash ...' calls is to prevent interpretation of the command as
# a dictionary by YAML parser.
