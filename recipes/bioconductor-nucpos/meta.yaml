  summary: 'nuCpos, a derivative of NuPoP, is an R package for prediction of nucleosome positions. In nuCpos, a duration hidden Markov model is trained with a chemical map of nucleosomes either from budding yeast, fission yeast, or mouse embryonic stem cells. nuCpos outputs the Viterbi (most probable) path of nucleosome-linker states, predicted nucleosome occupancy scores and histone binding affinity (HBA) scores as NuPoP does. nuCpos can also calculate local and whole nucleosomal HBA scores for a given 147-bp sequence. Furthermore, effect of genetic alterations on nucleosome occupancy can be predicted with this package. The parental package NuPoP, which is based on an MNase-seq-based map of budding yeast nucleosomes, was developed by Ji-Ping Wang and Liqun Xi, licensed under GPL-2.'
