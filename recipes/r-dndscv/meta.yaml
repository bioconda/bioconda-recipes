  summary: "dN/dS methods to quantify selection in cancer and somatic evolution."
  description: |
    Description: This package contains functions for studying selection on coding
    sequences using a Poisson implementation of dN/dS. A Poisson model of dN/dS
    facilitates the study of selection beyond traditional codon models, including
    complex context-dependent mutation effects and selection on nonsense and
    splice site mutations. This model is best suited for resequencing studies,
    with very low density of mutations per base pair. The model was initially
    developed for cancer genome sequencing studies, and specific functions are
    provided to perform driver gene discovery using the dNdScv method on human
    cancer genomic data.
