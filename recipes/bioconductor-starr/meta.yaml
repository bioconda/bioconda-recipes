  summary: 'Starr facilitates the analysis of ChIP-chip data, in particular that of
    Affymetrix tiling arrays. The package provides functions for data import, quality
    assessment, data visualization and exploration. Furthermore, it includes high-level
    analysis features like association of ChIP signals with annotated features, correlation
    analysis of ChIP signals and other genomic data (e.g. gene expression), peak-finding
    with the CMARRT algorithm and comparative display of multiple clusters of ChIP-profiles.
    It uses the basic Bioconductor classes ExpressionSet and probeAnno for maximum
    compatibility with other software on Bioconductor. All functions from Starr can
    be used to investigate preprocessed data from the Ringo package, and vice versa.
    An important novel tool is the the automated generation of correct, up-to-date
    microarray probe annotation (bpmap) files, which relies on an efficient mapping
    of short sequences (e.g. the probe sequences on a microarray) to an arbitrary
    genome.'
