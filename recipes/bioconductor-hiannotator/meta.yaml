  license: 'GPL (>= 2)'
  summary: 'hiAnnotator contains set of functions which allow users to annotate a GRanges object
    with custom set of annotations. The basic philosophy of this package is to take two GRanges
    objects (query & subject) with common set of seqnames (i.e. chromosomes) and return associated
    annotation per seqnames and rows from the query matching seqnames and rows from the subject
    (i.e. genes or cpg islands). The package comes with three types of annotation functions which
    calculates if a position from query is: within a feature, near a feature, or count features in
    defined window sizes. Moreover, each function is equipped with parallel backend to utilize the
    foreach package. In addition, the package is equipped with wrapper functions, which finds
    appropriate columns needed to make a GRanges object from a common data frame.'
