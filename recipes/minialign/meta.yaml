  summary: "Fast and accurate alignment tool for PacBio and Nanopore long reads."
  description: |
     Minialign is a little bit fast and moderately accurate nucleotide sequence 
     alignment tool designed for PacBio and Nanopore long reads. It is built on 
     three key algorithms, minimizer-based index of the minimap overlapper, 
     array-based seed chaining, and SIMD-parallel Smith-Waterman-Gotoh extension.
