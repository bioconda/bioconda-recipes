  summary: 'Turn a multiple GenBank records (either in multiple files or a single multi-record file) into a single record'
  description: |
    A small script to turn a multiple GenBank records (either in multiple files or a single multi-record file) into a 
    single record.
    Sequences are merged by concatenating them in order, and putting a spacer sequence between them.
    Spacer sequence length can be given in kbp. It is possible to pick an all-N spacer, or using a spacer
    consisting of all-frame stop codons.
