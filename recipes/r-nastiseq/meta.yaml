  summary: 'Pairs of RNA molecules transcribed from partially or entirely
  complementary loci are called cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs),
  and they play key roles in the regulation of gene expression in many organisms.
  A promising experimental tool for profiling sense and antisense transcription
  is strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq). To identify cis-NATs using
  ssRNA-seq, we developed a new computational method based on model comparison
  that incorporates the inherent variable efficiency of generating perfectly
  strand-specific libraries. Applying the method to new ssRNA-seq data from
  whole root and cell-type specific Arabidopsis libraries confirmed most of
  the known cis-NAT pairs and identified hundreds of additional cis-NAT pairs.'
