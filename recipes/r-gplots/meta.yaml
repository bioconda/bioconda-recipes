  summary: 'Various R programming tools for plotting data, including: - calculating and plotting
    locally smoothed summary functionals (''bandplot'', ''wapply''), - enhanced versions
    of standard plots (''barplot2'', ''boxplot2'', ''heatmap.2'', ''smartlegend''),
    - manipulating colors (''col2hex'', ''colorpanel'', ''redgreen'', ''greenred'',
    ''bluered'', ''redblue'', ''rich.colors''), - calculating and plotting two-dimensional
    data summaries (''ci2d'', ''hist2d''), - enhanced regression diagnostic plots (''lmplot2'',
    ''residplot''), - formula-enabled interface to stats::lowess function (''lowess''),
    - displaying textual data in plots (''textplot'', ''sinkplot''), - plotting a matrix
    where each cell contains a dot whose size reflects the relative magnitude of the
    elements (''balloonplot''), - plotting Venn diagrams (''venn''), - displaying Open-Office
    style plots (''ooplot''), - plotting multiple data sets on same region, with separate
    axes (''overplot''), - plotting means and confidence intervals (''plotCI'', ''plotmeans''),
    - spacing points in an x-y plot so they don''t overlap (''space'').'
