  summary: Overlaying of Correlation Circles and Network of Correlated Variables
  description: |
     visCorVar does analysis from data integration with the 
     function block.splsda (mixOmics package). visCorVar 
     performs the overlaying of correlation circles and a zoom
     in a rectangle to retrieve correlated variables. visCorVar 
     can create a network of correlated variables.
