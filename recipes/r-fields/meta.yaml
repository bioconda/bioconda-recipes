  summary: 'For curve, surface and function fitting with an emphasis on splines, spatial data
    and spatial statistics. The major methods include cubic, and thin plate splines,
    Kriging and compact covariances for large data sets. The splines and Kriging methods
    are supported by functions that can determine the smoothing parameter (nugget and
    sill variance) and other covariance parameters by cross validation and also by restricted
    maximum likelihood. For Kriging there is an easy to use function that also estimates
    the correlation scale (range parameter).  A major feature is that any covariance
    function implemented in R and following a simple format can be used for spatial
    prediction. There are also many useful functions for plotting and working with spatial
    data as images. This package also contains an implementation of sparse matrix methods
    for large spatial data sets and currently requires the sparse matrix (spam) package.
    Use help(fields) to get started and for an overview.  The fields source code is
    deliberately commented and provides useful explanations of numerical details as
    a companion to the manual pages. The commented source code can be viewed by expanding
    the package source code "tarball" (ending in tar.gz) and looking in the R subdirectory.
    The reference for fields can be generated by the citation function in R and has
    DOI <doi:10.5065/D6W957CT>. '
