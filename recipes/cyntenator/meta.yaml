  summary: 'progressive gene order alignments'
  description: >
    Cyntenator identifies conserved syntenic blocks between multiple genomes.
    The program computes Smith-Waterman alignments of sequences, whereby the alphabet consists of all annotated genes and the scoring system is defined by protein sequence similarities and distances between species in a phylogenetic tree.
    The algorithm is an extension of the Syntenator partial order aligner, described in RÃ¶delsperger and Dieterich, 2008.
