    summary: slncky is a tool for lncRNA discovery from RNA-Seq data. slncky filters a high-quality set of noncoding transcripts, discovers lncRNA orthologs, and characterizes conserved lncRNA evolution. slncky was developed as a collaboration between the Garber Lab at UMass Medical and the Regev Lab at the Broad Institute.
