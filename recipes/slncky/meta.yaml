  summary: slncky is a tool for lncRNA discovery from RNA-Seq data. slncky filters
    a high-quality set of noncoding transcripts, discovers lncRNA orthologs, and characterizes
    conserved lncRNA evolution. slncky was developed as a collaboration between the
    Garber Lab at UMass Medical and the Regev Lab at the Broad Institute.
