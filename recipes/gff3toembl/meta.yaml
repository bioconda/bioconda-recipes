  summary: Submitting annoated genomes to EMBL is a very difficult and time consuming process. This software converts GFF3 files from the most commonly use prokaryote annotation tool Prokka into a format that is suitable for submission to EMBL. It has been used to prepare more than 30% of all annotated genomes in EMBL/GenBank.
