  summary: 'Provides powerful and easy-to-use tools for analyzing next-gen sequencing
    read data. Includes quality assessment of sequence reads, read alignment, read
    summarization, exon-exon junction detection, fusion detection, detection of short
    and long indels, absolute expression calling and SNP calling. Can be used with
    reads generated from any of the major sequencing platforms including Illumina
    GA/HiSeq/MiSeq, Roche GS-FLX, ABI SOLiD and LifeTech Ion PGM/Proton sequencers.'
