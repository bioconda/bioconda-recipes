  summary: Phylogenetic estimation using (Maximum) Likelihood
  description: |
    PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from
    alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. The main strength of
    PhyML lies in the large number of substitution models coupled to various
    options to search the space of phylogenetic tree topologies, going from
    very fast and efficient methods to slower but generally more accurate
    approaches. PhyML was designed to process moderate to large data sets. In
    theory, alignments with up to 4,000 sequences 2,000,000 character-long
    can be processed. PhyML can process data sets made of multiple genes and
    fit sophisticated substitution models with heterogeneous components
    across partition elements.
