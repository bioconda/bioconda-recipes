  summary: Beta regression for modeling beta-distributed dependent variables, e.g., rates and
    proportions. In addition to maximum likelihood regression (for both mean and precision
    of a beta-distributed response), bias-corrected and bias-reduced estimation as well
    as finite mixture models and recursive partitioning for beta regressions are provided.
