  summary: Predicts small molecule metabolism.
  description: |
    BioTransformer is a software tool that predicts small molecule metabolism in mammals, their gut microbiota,
    as well as the soil/aquatic microbiota. BioTransformer also assists scientists in metabolite identification,
    based on the metabolism prediction.


extra:
  notes: |
    Biotransformer is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper python script.
    This python wrapper is called "biotransformer" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "biotransformer -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
