  summary: 'Pre-processor for bioinformatics cluster job submission'
  description: |
    Tardis is a pre-processor which reconditions (precompiles) a marked-up unix
    shell command to generate a sequence of conditioned commands which it then
    launches on a cluster.  The mark-up is added by the user to indicate the
    input(s) and output(s) of the command.  Tardis splits input files into
    conditioned input chunks and will uncondition (join together) the output
    chunks to obtain the final outputs, with the sequence of conditioned commands
    referring to conditioned input and output filenames.
