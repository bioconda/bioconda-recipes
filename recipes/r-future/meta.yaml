  summary: A Future API for R is provided. In programming, a future is an abstraction for a value
    that may be available at some point in the future. The state of a future can either
    be unresolved or resolved. As soon as it is resolved, the value is available. Futures
    are useful constructs in for instance concurrent evaluation, e.g. parallel processing
    and distributed processing on compute clusters. The purpose of this package is to
    provide a lightweight interface for using futures in R. Functions 'future()' and
    'value()' exist for creating futures and requesting their values, e.g. 'f <- future({
    mandelbrot(-0.75, 0, side=3) })' and 'v <- value(f)'. The 'resolved()' function
    can be used to check if a future is resolved or not. An infix assignment operator
    '%<-%' exists for creating futures whose values are accessible by the assigned variables
    (as promises), e.g. 'v %<-% { mandelbrot(-0.75, 0, side=3) }'. This package implements
    synchronous "lazy" and "eager" futures, and asynchronous "multicore", "multisession"
    and ad hoc "cluster" futures. Globals variables and functions are automatically
    identified and exported. Required packages are attached in external R sessions whenever
    needed. All types of futures are designed to behave the same such that the exact
    same code work regardless of futures used or number of cores, background sessions
    or cluster nodes available. Additional types of futures are provided by other packages
    enhancing this package.
