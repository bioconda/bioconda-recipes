  summary: RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic PLacement via Ancestral Sequences)
      is a program dedicated to Phylogenetic Placement of (meta)genomic reads on
      a reference tree. As apposed to previous PP programs, RAPPAS is based on the
      phylo-kmers idea, detailed in tis manuscript and uses a 2 step approach divided
      into a) the database build, and b) the placement itself. The main advantage
      of RAPPAS is that it is alignment free, which means that after step (a) (the
      DB build) is performed, metagenomic reads can be directly placed on a referene
      tree WITHOUT aligning them to the reference alignment on which the tree was
      built (as required by other approaches). The second advantage of RAPPAS is
      its algorithm based on phylo-kmers matches, making its execution time linear
      with respect to the length of the placed sequences.
