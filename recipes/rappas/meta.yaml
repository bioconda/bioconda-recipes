    summary: RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic PLacement via Ancestral Sequences)
        is a program dedicated to Phylogenetic Placement of (meta)genomic reads on
        a reference tree. As apposed to previous PP programs, RAPPAS is based on the
        phylo-kmers idea, detailed in tis manuscript and uses a 2 step approach divided
        into a) the database build, and b) the placement itself.

    summary: RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic PLacement via Ancestral Sequences)
        is a program dedicated to Phylogenetic Placement of (meta)genomic reads on
        a reference tree. As apposed to previous PP programs, RAPPAS is based on the
        phylo-kmers idea, detailed in tis manuscript and uses a 2 step approach divided
        into a) the database build, and b) the placement itself. The main advantage
        of RAPPAS is that it is alignment free, which means that after step (a) (the
        DB build) is performed, metagenomic reads can be directly placed on a referene
        tree WITHOUT aligning them to the reference alignment on which the tree was
        built (as required by other approaches). The second advantage of RAPPAS is
        its algorithm based on phylo-kmers matches, making its execution time linear
        with respect to the length of the placed sequences.
