  summary: "Wastewater-Based Epidemiology using Phylogenetic Placements"
  description:
    WEPP (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology using Phylogenetic Placements) is a 
    pathogen-agnostic pipeline that enhances wastewater surveillance by leveraging 
    the pathogen's full phylogeny. It reports haplotype and lineage abundances, 
    maps reads parsimoniously to selected haplotypes, and flags Unaccounted Alleles 
    — those observed in the sample but unexplained by selected haplotypes, 
    potentially indicating novel variants.
    
    WEPP performs parsimonious read placement on the mutation-annotated tree (MAT) 
    to select a subset of haplotypes and adds their neighbors to form an initial 
    candidate pool, which is passed to a deconvolution algorithm to estimate their 
    relative abundances. An interactive dashboard enables visualization of 
    haplotypes in the global phylogenetic tree and read-level analysis.
