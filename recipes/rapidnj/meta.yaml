  summary: RapidNJ is an algorithmic engineered implementation of canonical
    neighbour-joining. It uses an efficient search heuristic to speed-up the
    core computations of the neighbour-joining method that enables RapidNJ to
    outperform other state-of-the-art neighbour-joining implementations.
