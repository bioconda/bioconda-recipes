  summary:  Pipeline for comprehensive analysis of shotgun proteomics data
  description: |
    FragPipe is a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a suite of computational tools
    enabling comprehensive analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.
    It is powered by MSFragger - an ultrafast proteomic search engine suitable
    for both conventional and "open" (wide precursor mass tolerance) peptide identification.
    FragPipe includes the Philosopher toolkit for downstream post-processing of
    MSFragger search results (PeptideProphet, iProphet, ProteinProphet), FDR filtering,
    label-based quantification, and multi-experiment summary report generation.
    Crystal-C and PTM-Shepherd are included to aid interpretation of open search results.
    Also included in FragPipe binary are TMT-Integrator for TMT/iTRAQ isobaric
    labeling-based quantification, IonQuant for label-free quantification with
    match-between-run (MBR) functionality, spectral library building with EasyPQP,
    and MSFragger-DIA and DIA-Umpire SE modules for direct analysis of data independent
    acquisition (DIA) data.
