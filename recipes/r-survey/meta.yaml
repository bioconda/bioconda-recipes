  summary: Summary statistics, two-sample tests, rank tests, generalised linear models, cumulative
    link models, Cox models, loglinear models, and general maximum pseudolikelihood
    estimation for multistage stratified, cluster-sampled, unequally weighted survey
    samples. Variances by Taylor series linearisation or replicate weights. Post-stratification,
    calibration, and raking. Two-phase subsampling designs. Graphics. PPS sampling without
    replacement. Principal components, factor analysis.
