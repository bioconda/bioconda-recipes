    summary: Oligomap is a program for fast identification of nearly-perfect matches of small RNAs in sequence databases. It allows to exhaustively identify all the perfect and 1-error (where an error is defined to be a mismatch, insertion or deletion) matches of large sets of small RNAs to target sequences. Optimal performance is achieved at about 500000 query sequences (~2GB of memory).
