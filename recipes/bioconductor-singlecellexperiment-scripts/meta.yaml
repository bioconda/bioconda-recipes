  summary: A set of wrappers for operations associated with the
      SingleCellExperiment package. Functions in R packages are hard to call when
      building workflows outside of R, so this package adds a set of simple
      wrappers with robust argument parsing. Intermediate steps are currently
      mainly serialized R objects, but the ultimate objective is to have
      language-agnostic intermediate formats allowing composite workflows using a
      variety of software packages.
