  summary: EGA download client v2
  license: unknown
  description: |
    The most up-to-date download client for EGA can be found in the pyega3
    package. However, that tool does not download a fairly large chunk of EGA
    files (those ending in .gpg rather than .cip), which limits its generic
    usefulness. This package attempts to provide the v2 Java client in a more
    useful manner than a simple .jar.
