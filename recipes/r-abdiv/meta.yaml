  description: |
          'A collection of measures for measuring ecological diversity.
           Ecological diversity comes in two flavors: alpha diversity measures the
           diversity within a single site or sample, and beta diversity measures the
           diversity across two sites or samples. This package overlaps considerably
           with other R packages such as ''vegan'', ''gUniFrac'', ''betapart'', and ''fossil''.
           We also include a wide range of functions that are implemented in software
           outside the R ecosystem, such as ''scipy'', ''Mothur'', and ''scikit-bio''.  The
           implementations here are designed to be basic and clear to the reader.'
