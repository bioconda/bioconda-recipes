  summary: 'Evaluation of thermodynamic and kinetic features of RNA-RNA interactions.'
  description: |
    RRIkinDP evaluated thermodynamic and kinetic features of RNA-RNA interactions. As input, two RNA
    sequences as well as their interaction structure is provided. The tool generates the state space of
    all intermediate interactions from single base pair interactions to the full input interaction.
    On top of this state space it computes the barrier energy for the best direct path from a given
    start interaction to the full input interaction.
