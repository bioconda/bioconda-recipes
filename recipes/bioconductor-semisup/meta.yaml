  summary: 'This R packages moves away from testing interaction terms, and move towards testing whether an
    individual SNP is involved in any interaction. This reduces the multiple testing burden to one test per
    SNP, and allows for interactions with unobserved factors. Analysing one SNP at a time, it splits the
    individuals into two groups, based on the number of minor alleles. If the quantitative trait differs in
    mean between the two groups, the SNP has a main effect. If the quantitative trait differs in distribution
    between some individuals in one group and all other individuals, it possibly has an interactive effect.
    Implicitly, the membership probabilities may suggest potential interacting variables.'
