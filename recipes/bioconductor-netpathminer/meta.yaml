  summary: 'NetPathMiner is a general framework for network path mining using genome-scale
    networks. It constructs networks from KGML, SBML and BioPAX files, providing three
    network representations, metabolic, reaction and gene representations. NetPathMiner
    finds active paths and applies machine learning methods to summarize found paths
    for easy interpretation. It also provides static and interactive visualizations
    of networks and paths to aid manual investigation.'
