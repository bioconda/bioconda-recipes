about:
  #home:
  license: GPL-2
  summary: Provides implementations of functions which have been introduced in R since version
    3.0.0. The backports are conditionally exported which results in R resolving the
    function names to the version shipped with R (if available) and uses the implemented
    backports as fallback. This way package developers can make use of the new functions
    without worrying about the minimum required R version.
