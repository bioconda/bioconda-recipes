  summary: "Super-fast Normalization and Trimming for Amplicon Sequencing Data (Long- and Short-read)"
  description: "NoTrAmp is a Tool for super fast trimming and read-depth normalization of amplicon reads. It is designed to be used in amplicon-tiling panels\
    \ (or similar multiplexed amplicon sequencing approaches) to cap coverage of each amplicon (if desired) and to trim amplicons to their appropriate length\
    \ removing barcodes, adpaters and primers (if desired) in a single clipping step.\n\nNoTrAmp is suitable for use with both long (e.g. ONT/PacBio) and short\
    \ reads (e.g Illumina). When using reads that are significantly shorter than amplicon sizes, you should adjust the minimum required alignment length\
    \ using the --set_min_len argument.\n\nSee the projects [home](https://github.com/simakro/NoTrAmp) for usage and additional documentation."
