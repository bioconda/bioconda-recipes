  summary: CADD scripts release for offline scoring
  description: |
    This package contains the CADD-scripts.  Please note that the "CADD.sh"
    script is available as "cadd.sh" while the "install.sh" script is
    available as "cadd-install.sh".

    The "Prerequisite" steps from the CADD-scripts repository README can
    be skipped as you already have conda installed with the proper channels
    if you can install this package and this package depends on the proper
    Snakemake version.
