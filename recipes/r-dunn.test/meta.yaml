  summary: Computes Dunn's test (1964) for stochastic dominance and reports the results among
    multiple pairwise comparisons after a Kruskal-Wallis test for stochastic dominance
    among k groups (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952). The interpretation of stochastic dominance
    requires an assumption that the CDF of one group does not cross the CDF of the other.
    'dunn.test' makes k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on Dunn's z-test-statistic
    approximations to the actual rank statistics. The null hypothesis for each pairwise
    comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly selected value from the
    first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the second group
    equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
    rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous,
    and the distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location,
    Dunn's test may be understood as a test for median difference. 'dunn.test' accounts
    for tied ranks.
