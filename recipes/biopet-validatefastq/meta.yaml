  summary: This tool validates a FASTQ file.
  description: |-
    This tool validates a FASTQ file. When data is paired it can
    also validate a pair of FASTQ files.
    ValidateFastq will check if the FASTQ is in valid FASTQ format.
    This includes checking for duplicate reads and checking whether
    a pair of FASTQ files contains the same amount of reads and headers match.
    It also check whether the quality encodings are correct and outputs
    the most likely encoding format (Sanger, Solexa etc.).

extra:
  notes: 'biopet-validatefastq is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper
    shell script. By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The
    command that runs the program is ''biopet-validatefastq''. If you want to overwrite
    it you can specify memory options directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence. For example run it with ''biopet-validatefastq
    -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
