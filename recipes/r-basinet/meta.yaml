  summary: It makes the creation of networks from sequences of RNA, with this is done the abstraction
    of characteristics of these networks with a methodology of threshold for the purpose
    of making a classification between the classes of the sequences. There are two data
    present in the 'BASiNET' package, "sequences" and "sequences2" with 11 and 10 sequences
    respectively. These sequences were taken from the data set used in the article (LI,
    Aimin; ZHANG, Junying; ZHOU, Zhongyin, 2014) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-311>. These
    sequences are used to run examples.
