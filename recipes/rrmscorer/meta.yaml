  summary: "RRMScorer (RRM-RNA score predictor) predicts how likely a single RRM is to bind ssRNA"
  description: |
    RRMScorer (RRM-RNA score predictor) allows the user to easily predict
    how likely a single RRM is to bind ssRNA using a carefully generated
    alignment for the RRM structures in complex with RNA, from which we
    analyzed the interaction patterns and derived the scores (please
    address to the publication for more details on the method REF).

    RRMScorer has several features to either calculate the binding score
    for a specific RRM and RNA sequences, for a set of RRM sequences in a
    FASTA file, or to explore which are the best RNA binders according to our scoring method.

    RRMScorer has been developed by Bio2Byte within the RNAct project. This project has received
    funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under
    the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 813239.
