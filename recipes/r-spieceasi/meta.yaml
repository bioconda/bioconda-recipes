  summary: A means to explore the structure of 16S rRNA surveys using a Structural  Topic Model
    coupled with functional prediction. The user provides an abundance  table, sample
    metadata, and taxonomy information, and themetagenomics infers  associations between
    topics and sample features, as well as topics and predicted  functional content.
    Functional prediction can be accomplished via Tax4Fun (for  Silva references) and
    PICRUSt (for GreenGeenes references).
