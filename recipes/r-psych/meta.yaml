  summary: A general purpose toolbox for personality, psychometrics and experimental psychology.   Functions
    are primarily for multivariate analysis and scale construction using factor analysis,
    principal component analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although
    others provide basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is done using  factor
    analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing data
    at multi-levels include within and between group statistics, including correlations
    and factor analysis.   Functions for simulating particular item and test structures
    are included. Several functions serve as a useful front end for structural equation
    modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation
    models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support
    a book on psychometrics as well as publications in personality research. For more
    information, see the personality-project.org/r webpage.
