  summary: |
    The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for
    Short-Reads FASTA/FASTQ files preprocessing.

    Next-Generation sequencing machines usually produce FASTA or FASTQ files,
    containing multiple short-reads sequences (possibly with quality
    information).

    The main processing of such FASTA/FASTQ files is mapping (aka aligning) the
    sequences to reference genomes or other databases using specialized
    programs. Example of such mapping programs are: Blat, SHRiMP, LastZ, MAQ
    and many many others

    However, it is sometimes more productive to preprocess the FASTA/FASTQ files
    before mapping the sequences to the genome - manipulating the sequences to
    produce better mapping results.

    The FASTX-Toolkit tools perform some of these preprocessing tasks.'
