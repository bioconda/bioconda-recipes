  summary: 'The package is able to perform an automatic or interactive quality control
    on FCS data acquired using flow cytometry instruments. By evaluating three different
    properties: 1) flow rate, 2) signal acquisition, 3) dynamic range, the quality
    control enables the detection and removal of anomalies.'
