  summary: Statistical models of biased sampling in the form of  univariate and multivariate
    noncentral hypergeometric distributions,  including Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric
    distribution and Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution  (also called extended
    hypergeometric distribution).   See vignette("UrnTheory") for explanation of these
    distributions.
