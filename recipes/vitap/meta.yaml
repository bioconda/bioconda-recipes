  summary: Viral Taxonomic Assignment Pipeline
  doc_url: https://github.com/DrKaiyangZheng/VITAP/blob/main/README.md
  description: Viral Taxonomic Assignment Pipeline (VITAP) is a cutting-edge tool designed to address the growing need for accurate and comprehensive taxonomic assignments of DNA and RNA viral sequences. By integrating alignment-based techniques with graph theory, VITAP achieves high precision in classifying viral sequences, including those as short as 1000 base pairs, down to the genus level.
