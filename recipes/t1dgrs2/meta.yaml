  summary: Generate a Type 1 Diabetes Genetic Risk Score (T1D GRS) that accounts for interactions between HLA DR-DQ risk haplotypes.
  description: "An improved T1D GRS (by Sharp et al., 2019) that incorporates both non-HLA and HLA risk components in discriminating between cases and controls, by accounting for interactions between HLA DR-DQ haplotype combinations. This uses 67 T1D-associated variants in either GRCh37 or GRCh38 to perform both a linear scoring of the genetic risk, with the added HLA DR-DQ interaction effect for the final GRS.\nThis Python package can be used on both imputed genotyping array and next generation sequencing (e.g., whole genome sequencing) input datasets, but will require quality control procedures to be applied beforehand.\nRequired: PLINK 1.9 fileset (.bed, .bim, .fam).\n\
