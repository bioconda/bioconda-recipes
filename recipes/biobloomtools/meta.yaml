  description: |
    BioBloom Tools (BBT) provides the means to create filters for a given reference and then to categorizes sequences. This methodology is faster than alignment but does not provide mapping locations. BBT was initially intended to be used for pre-processing and QC applications like contamination detection, but is flexible to accommodate other purposes.
