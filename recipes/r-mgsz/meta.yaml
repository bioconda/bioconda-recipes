  summary: Performs gene set analysis based on GSZ scoring function and asymptotic p-value. It
    is different from GSZ in that it implements asymptotic p-values instead of empirical
    p-values. Asymptotic p-values are calculated by fitting suitable distribution model
    to the null distribution. Unlike empirical p-values, resolution of asymptotic p-values
    are independent of the number of permutations and hence requires considerably fewer
    permutations. In addition, this package allows gene set analysis with seven other
    popular gene set analysis methods.
