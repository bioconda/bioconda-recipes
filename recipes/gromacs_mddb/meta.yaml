  summary: GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics.
  description: |
    Development version of GROMACS in colaboration to MDDB to add the
    possibility to export tpr to json.

    GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e.
    simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds
    to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical
    molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of
    complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast
    at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate
    simulations) many groups are also using it for research on
    non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.
