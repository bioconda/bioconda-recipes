  summary: 'A method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation
    networks (e.g., gene co-expression networks), which builds on a commonly used association
    measure, such as Pearson''s correlation coefficient. This package includes functions
    to calculate correlation matrices for high-dimensional dataset and to test differential
    correlation, which means the changes in the correlation relationship among variables
    (e.g., genes and metabolites) between 2 experimental conditions. '
