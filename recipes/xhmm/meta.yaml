  description: "The XHMM C++ software suite was written to call copy number variation (CNV) from next-generation sequencing projects, 
  where exome capture was used (or targeted sequencing, more generally). XHMM uses principal component analysis (PCA) normalization and 
  a hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect and genotype copy number variation (CNV) from normalized read-depth data from targeted sequencing 
  experiments. XHMM was explicitly designed to be used with targeted exome sequencing at high coverage (at least 60x - 100x) 
  using Illumina HiSeq (or similar) sequencing of at least ~50 samples."
