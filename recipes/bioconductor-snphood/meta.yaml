  summary: 'To date, thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been
    found to be associated with complex traits and diseases. However, the vast majority
    of these disease-associated SNPs lie in the non-coding part of the genome, and
    are likely to affect regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, rather
    than function of a protein. Thus, to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
    genetic traits and diseases, it becomes increasingly important to study the effect
    of a SNP on nearby molecular traits such as chromatin environment or transcription
    factor (TF) binding. Towards this aim, we developed SNPhood, a user-friendly *Bioconductor*
    R package to investigate and visualize the local neighborhood of a set of SNPs
    of interest for NGS data such as chromatin marks or transcription factor binding
    sites from ChIP-Seq or RNA- Seq experiments. SNPhood comprises a set of easy-to-use
    functions to extract, normalize and summarize reads for a genomic region, perform
    various data quality checks, normalize read counts using additional input files,
    and to cluster and visualize the regions according to the binding pattern. The
    regions around each SNP can be binned in a user-defined fashion to allow for analysis
    of very broad patterns as well as a detailed investigation of specific binding
    shapes. Furthermore, SNPhood supports the integration with genotype information
    to investigate and visualize genotype-specific binding patterns. Finally, SNPhood
    can be employed for determining, investigating, and visualizing allele-specific
    binding patterns around the SNPs of interest.'
