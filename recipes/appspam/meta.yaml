  summary: App-SpaM (Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement algorithm based on  
      Spaced-word Matches) is a software that performs phylogenetic placement
      on assembled or unassembled refernence sequences.
      App-SpaM takes as input a reference phylogeny in newick format, a fasta file
      of the same reference sequences that are at the leaves of the reference tree, 
      and a fasta file of query sequences. The queries are then placed onto the
      reference pyhlogeny and a JPlace file containing all placement locations is
      returned.
      For the placement, App-SpaM uses filtered spaced-word matches between queries
      and references to calculate phylogenetic query-references distances. Different 
      heuristics based either on the number of spaced-words or the estimated distances
      then place the queries in the reference phylogeny. For detailed information see 
      our paper 'Pyhlogenetic placement of short reads without sequence alignment'.
