  summary: 'A pure data-driven gene network, weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN)
    could be constructed only from expression profile. Different layers in such networks
    may represent different time points, multiple conditions or various species. AMOUNTAIN
    aims to search active modules in multi-layer WGCN using a continuous optimization
    approach.'
