  summary: "Clone trees for Cancer Evolution studies from bulk sequencing data."
  description: |
    The ctree package implements clones trees for cancer evolutionary studies. 
    These models are built from Cancer Cell Franctions (CCFs) clusters computed via 
    tumour subclonal deconvolution, using either one or more tumour biopsies at once. 
    They can be used to model evolutionary trajectories from bulk sequencing data, 
    especially if whole-genome sequencing is available. The package implements S3 
    objects for the mutation trees, as well as a Monte Carlo sampler to generate them, 
    as well as functions to plot and analyze the trees. The sibling of a clone tree is 
    a mutation tree, which is built from binary mutation profiles; refer to the mtree 
    package for mutation trees.
