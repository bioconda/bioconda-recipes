  summary: "A curated database of completed assemblies with taxonomy IDs"
  description: |
    Kalamari is a curated database of assemblies and taxonomies.
    These assemblies are curated mainly for foodborne bacteria but have other taxa
    such as SARS-CoV-2 and Crytposporidium.
    Taxonomy has been modified from NCBI Taxonomy and has been minimalized to
    just what is needed here.
