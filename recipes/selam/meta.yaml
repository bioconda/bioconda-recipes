  summary: "Simulation of Epistasis Local adaptation, with Ancestry and Mate choice"
  description: |
    SELAM (Simulation of Epistasis, Local adaptation with Admixture and Mate
    choice) is a forward time population genetic simulation for studying
    admixture between ancestral subpopulations. This program tracks local
    ancestry along chromosomes. SELAM supports complex demography
    scenarios, including changes in population sizes, migration rates, and
    arbitrary numbers of subpopulations. This program can also accommodate
    sophisticated selective regimes, including dominance, epistasis, local
    adaptation, and mate choice.
