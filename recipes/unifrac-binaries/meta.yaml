  summary: 'Fast phylogenetic diversity calculations'
  description: |
    UniFrac is a commonly phylogenetic diversity distance metric used in
    microbiome research. The metric relates two microbiome samples together
    within the context of an evolutionary history, and produces a distance
    that corresponds to how similar two samples by the amount of overlapping
    branch length. This package contains command line utilities and
    a shared library.
