  summary: Reference based multiple sequence alignment
  description: |
    SINA allows incorporating additional sequences into an existing
    multiple sequence alignment (MSA) without modifying the original
    alignment. While adding sequences to an MSA with SINA is usually
    faster than re-computing the entire MSA from an augmented set of
    unaligned sequences, the primary benefit lies in protecting
    investments made into the original MSA such as manual curation of the
    alignment, compute intensive phylogenetic tree reconstruction and
    taxonomic annotation of the resulting phylogeny.

    Additionally, SINA includes a homology search which uses the
    previously computed alignment to determine the most similar
    sequences. Based on the search results, a LCA based classification of
    the query sequence can be computed using taxonomic classifications
    assigned to the sequences comprising the reference MSA.

    SINA is used to compute the small and large subunit ribosomal RNA
    alignments provided by the SILVA_ project and is able to use the ARB_
    format reference databases released by the project.
