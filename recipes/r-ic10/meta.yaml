  summary: Implementation of the classifier described in the paper 'Genome-driven integrated
    classification of breast cancer validated in over 7,500 samples' (Ali HR et al.,
    Genome Biology 2014). It uses copy number and/or expression from breast cancer data,
    trains a pamr classifier (Tibshirani et al.) with the features available and predicts
    the iC10 group.
