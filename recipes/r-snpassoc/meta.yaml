  summary: 'This package carries out most common analysis when performing whole genome association
    studies. These analyses include descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis
    of missing values, calculation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, analysis of association
    based on generalized linear models (either for quantitative or binary traits), and
    analysis of multiple SNPs (haplotype and epistasis analysis). Permutation test and
    related tests (sum statistic and truncated product) are also implemented. Max-statistic
    and genetic risk-allele score exact distributions are also possible to be estimated. '
