  summary: 'Produces Summaries and Plots of Features Distributed Across Genomes'
  description: 'If you have a set of genomic ranges, this package can help you with visualization and comparison. It produces several kinds of plots, for example: Chromosome distribution plots, which visualize how your regions are distributed over chromosomes; feature distance distribution plots, which visualizes how your regions are distributed relative to a feature of interest, like Transcription Start Sites (TSSs); genomic partition plots, which visualize how your regions overlap given genomic features such as promoters, introns, exons, or intergenic regions. It also makes it easy to compare one set of ranges to another.'
