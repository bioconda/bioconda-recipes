  summary: Generates Rd files from R source code with comments. The main features of the default
    syntax are that (1) docs are defined in comments near the relevant code, (2) function
    argument names are not repeated in comments, and (3) examples are defined in R code,
    not comments. It is also easy to define a new syntax.
