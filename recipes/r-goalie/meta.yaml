  summary: Assertive check functions for defensive R programming. 
    goalie is an attempt to incorporate elements of multiple assertive check
    packages into a single package with as few dependencies as possible. All
    assertive checks are written in the most basic R code possible, without
    reliance on compilation (e.g. C++/Rcpp). It is still a work in progress,
    and feature requests are welcome.
