  summary: 'We developed the PARalyzer algorithm to generate a high resolution
  map of interaction sites between RNA-binding proteins and their targets. The
  algorithm utilizes the deep sequencing reads generated by PAR-CLIP
  (Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and
  Immunoprecipitation) protocol.The use of photoactivatable nucleotides in the
  PAR-CLIP protocol results in more efficient crosslinking between the
  RNA-binding protein and its target relative to other CLIP methods; in addition
  a nucleotide substitution occurs at the site of crosslinking, providing for
  single-nucleotide resolution binding information. PARalyzer utilizes this
  nucleotide substition in a kernel density estimate classifier to generate
  the high resolution set of Protein-RNA interaction sites.'
