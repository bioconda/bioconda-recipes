  summary: 'In a typical microarray setting with gene expression data observed under
    two conditions, the local false discovery rate describes the probability that
    a gene is not differentially expressed between the two conditions given its corrresponding
    observed score or p-value level. The resulting curve of p-values versus local
    false discovery rate offers an insight into the twilight zone between clear differential
    and clear non-differential gene expression. Package ''twilight'' contains two
    main functions: Function twilight.pval performs a two-condition test on differences
    in means for a given input matrix or expression set and computes permutation based
    p-values. Function twilight performs a stochastic downhill search to estimate
    local false discovery rates and effect size distributions. The package further
    provides means to filter for permutations that describe the null distribution
    correctly. Using filtered permutations, the influence of hidden confounders could
    be diminished.'
