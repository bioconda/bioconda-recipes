  summary: 'Package for prediction of zygosity for variants/genes in NGS data'
  description: 'The ZygosityPredictor allows to predict how many copies of a gene are affected by small variants. In addition to the basic calculations of the affected copy number of a variant, the Zygosity-Predictor can integrate the influence of several variants on a gene and ultimately make a statement if and how many wild-type copies of the gene are left. This information proves to be of particular use in the context of translational medicine. For example, in cancer genomes, the Zygosity-Predictor can address whether unmutated copies of tumor-suppressor genes are present. Beyond this, it is possible to make this statement for all genes of an organism. The Zygosity-Predictor was primarily developed to handle SNVs and INDELs (later addressed as small-variants) of somatic and germline origin. In order not to overlook severe effects outside of the small-variant context, it has been extended with the assessment of large scale deletions, which cause losses of whole genes or parts of them.'
