  summary: "ConsensusTME is a consensus based approach to generating cancer
    specific gene sets for multiple cell types found within the tumour
    microenvironment. This package allows access to these genesets and
    provides a wrapper for using these gene sets with various statistical
    frameworks to generate normalised enrichment scores.
    These can be used to identify relative quantities of cell types across
    multiple samples."
