  summary: 'Variable selection methods are provided for several classification methods: the lasso/elastic
    net, PCLDA, PLSDA, and several t-tests. Two approaches for selecting cutoffs can
    be used, one based on the stability of model coefficients under perturbation, and
    the other on higher criticism.'
