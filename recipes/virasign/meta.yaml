  summary: Virasign is a viral taxonomic classification tool designed for nanopore sequencing data.
  description: |
    Virasign (Viral Read ASSIGNment) is a viral taxonomic classification and reference selection tool for nanopore data. 
    It maps long-read sequencing data (via minimap2) against viral databases (RVDB, RefSeq, or custom accessions) and performs 
    taxonomic classification to identify viral species. Virasign generates comprehensive interactive HTML reports with filterable 
    tables, charts and heatmaps. For each identified virus, Virasign also provides the closest reference sequence, mapped reads in 
    FASTQ format, and BAM files which can be used to easily generate a consensus genome and visualize data (e.g., IGV). Virasign 
    includes options to blind yourself from certain incidental findings (such as HIV, Hepatitis viruses, HTLV, EBV, CMV, HPV) when 
    wanted, ensuring these findings do not appear in any output files, in line with consent guidelines and ethical research practices.
