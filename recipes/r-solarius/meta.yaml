  summary: SOLAR is the standard software program to perform linkage and association mappings
    of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity.
    This package allows the user to exploit the variance component methods implemented
    in SOLAR. It automates such routine operations as formatting pedigree and phenotype
    data. It also parses the model output and contains summary and plotting functions
    for exploration of the results. In addition, solarius enables parallel computing
    of the linkage and association analyses, that makes the calculation of genome-wide
    scans more efficient. See <http://solar.txbiomedgenetics.org/> for more information
    about SOLAR.
