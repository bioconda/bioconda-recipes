# gevent support for Python 3.x is recent and introduced a python3 syntax that
# leads to a syntax error in Python 2.x (gevent/_socket3.py ). Although the
# syntax error is handled by pip, it is not within a docker of conda build. The
# author do not plan to change this behavious for now since pip handles the
# error (https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/478  and
# https://github.com/gevent/gevent/pull/740 for information)
#
# So, we use two packages for python2 and python3
