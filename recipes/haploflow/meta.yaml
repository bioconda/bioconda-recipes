  summary: 'Strain-aware viral genome assembler for short read sequence data'
  description: |
    Haploflow is a strain-aware viral genome assembler for short read sequence data. 
    It uses a flow algorithm on a deBruijn graph data structure to resolve viral strains. 
    Haploflow is still actively under development and written entirely in C++.
