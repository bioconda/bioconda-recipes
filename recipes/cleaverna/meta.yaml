  summary: 'Computational tool for scoring candidate cleavage sites of DNAzyme'
  description: |
    CleaveRNA is Advanced machine learning-based computational tool for scoring candidate
    DNAzyme cleavage sites in substrate RNA sequences using structural and
    thermodynamic features. The tool supports multiple
    analysis modes including training and prediction.
    Key features:
    - Machine learning-based cleavage site prediction
    - Multiple prediction modes for different use cases
    - Feature extraction and model training capabilities
    - Cross-validation and performance metrics
    - Command-line interface for easy integration into workflows
