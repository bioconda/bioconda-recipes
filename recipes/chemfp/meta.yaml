  summary: |
    chemfp is a set of command-lines tools for generating cheminformatics fingerprints and searching those
    fingerprints by Tanimoto similarity, as well as a Python library which can be used to build new tools.
    
    These algorithms are designed for the dense, 100-10,000 bit
    fingerprints which occur in small-molecule/pharmaceutical
    chemisty. The Tanimoto search algorithms are implemented in C for
    performance and support both threshold and k-nearest searches.
    
    Fingerprint generation can be done either by extracting existing
    fingerprint data from an SD file or by using an existing chemistry
    toolkit. chemfp supports the Python libraries from Open Babel,
    OpenEye, and RDKit toolkits.
