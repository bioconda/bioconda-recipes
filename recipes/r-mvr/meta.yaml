  summary: 'This is a non-parametric method for joint adaptive mean-variance regularization and
    variance stabilization of high-dimensional data. It is suited for handling difficult
    problems posed by high-dimensional multivariate datasets (p >> n paradigm). Among
    those are that the variance is often a function of the mean, variable-specific estimators
    of variances are not reliable, and tests statistics have low powers due to a lack
    of degrees of freedom. Key features include: (i) Normalization and/or variance stabilization
    of the data, (ii) Computation of mean-variance-regularized t-statistics (F-statistics
    to follow), (iii) Generation of diverse diagnostic plots, (iv) Computationally efficient
    implementation using C/C++ interfacing and an option for parallel computing to enjoy
    a faster and easier experience in the R environment.'
