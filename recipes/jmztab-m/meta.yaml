  summary: This project is the reference reader, writer and validator implementation for mzTab for metabolomics 2.0+.
  description: |
        mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results from
        metabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is further intended to
        provide local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a 
        simple way to share and combine basic information. mzTab-M has been
        developed with a view to support the following general tasks. Facilitate 
        the sharing of final experimental results, especially with researchers 
        outside the field of metabolomics. Export of results to external software,
        including programs such as Microsoft Excel and Open Office Spreadsheet
        and statistical software / coding languages such as R. Act as an output
        format of (web-) services that report MS-based results and thus can 
        produce standardized result pages. Be able to link to the external 
        experimental evidence e.g. by referencing back to mzML files.

extra:
  notes: |
    jmzTab-M is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "jmztab-m -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
