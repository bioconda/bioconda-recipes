  summary: This project is the reference reader, writer and validator implementation for mzTab for metabolomics 2.0+.
  description: |
        mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results from metabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is further intended to provide local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a simple way to share and combine basic information. mzTab-M has been developed with a view to support the following general tasks: 1. Facilitate the sharing of final experimental results, especially with researchers outside the field of metabolomics. 2. Export of results to external software, including programs such as Microsoft Excel® and Open Office Spreadsheet and statistical software / coding languages such as R. 3. Act as an output format of (web-) services that report MS-based results and thus can produce standardized result pages. 4. Be able to link to the external experimental evidence e.g. by referencing back to mzML files.



extra:
  notes: |
    jmzTab-M is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "jmztab-m -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
