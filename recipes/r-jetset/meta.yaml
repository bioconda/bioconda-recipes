  summary: 'On Affymetrix gene expression microarrays, a single gene may be measured by multiple
    probe sets. This can present a mild conundrum when attempting to evaluate a gene
    "signature" that is defined by gene names rather than by specific probe sets. This
    package provides a one-to-one mapping from gene to "best" probe set for four Affymetrix
    human gene expression microarrays: hgu95av2, hgu133a, hgu133plus2, and u133x3p.
    This package also includes the pre-calculated probe set quality scores that were
    used to define the mapping.'
