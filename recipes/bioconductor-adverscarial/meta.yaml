  summary: adverSCarial, generate and analyze the vulnerability of scRNA-seq classifier to adversarial attacks
  description: adverSCarial is an R Package designed for generating and analyzing the vulnerability of scRNA-seq classifiers to adversarial attacks. The package is versatile and provides a format for integrating any type of classifier. It offers functions for studying and generating two types of attacks, single gene attack and max change attack. The single-gene attack involves making a small modification to the input to alter the classification. The max-change attack involves making a large modification to the input without changing its classification. The CGD attack is based on an estimated gradient descent. against adversarial attacks. The package provides a comprehensive solution for evaluating the robustness of scRNA-seq classifiers against adversarial attacks.
