  summary: ImageJ / Fiji plugin implementing an iterative Largest Inscribed Circle algorithm using a euclidean distance map
  description: |
    ImageJ / Fiji plugin implementing an iterative Largest Inscribed Circle algorithm
    which runs over a binary image or selection in order to fit the maximum number
    of non-touching circles down to a minimum diameter.
    The approach uses a Euclidean Distance Map in order to find candidate circles
    from the largest to the smallest.
    The code is written for Java 8,
    which is the currently supported Java version for Fiji and ImageJ.
