  summary: This script sorts and (optionally) filters the rows/variants of a VCF
    file (containing data for 2 or more samples) based on the differences in the
    variant data between samples or sample groups. Degree of "difference" is
    determined by either the best possible degree of separation of sample groups
    by genotype calls or the difference in average allelic frequency of each
    sample or sample group (with a gap size threshold). The pair of samples or
    sample groups used to represent the difference for a variant row is the one
    leading to the greatest difference in consistent genotype or average allelic
    frequencies (i.e. observation ratios, e.g. AO/DP) of the same variant state.
    If sample groups are not specified, the pair of samples leading to the
    greatest difference is greedily discovered and chosen to represent the
    variant/row.
