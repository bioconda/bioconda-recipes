  summary: 'A supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional grid seamlessly
    consisting of smaller hexagons. It is supposed to train, analyse and visualise
    a high-dimensional omics input data. The supraHex is able to carry out gene clustering/meta-clustering
    and sample correlation, plus intuitive visualisations to facilitate exploratory
    analysis. More importantly, it allows for overlaying additional data onto the
    trained map to explore relations between input and additional data. So with supraHex,
    it is also possible to carry out multilayer omics data comparisons. Newly added
    utilities are advanced heatmap visualisation and tree-based analysis of sample
    relationships. Uniquely to this package, users can ultrafastly understand any
    tabular omics data, both scientifically and artistically, especially in a sample-specific
    fashion but without loss of information on large genes.'
