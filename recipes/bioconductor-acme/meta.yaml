  summary: 'ACME (Algorithms for Calculating Microarray Enrichment) is a set of tools
    for analysing tiling array ChIP/chip, DNAse hypersensitivity, or other experiments
    that result in regions of the genome showing "enrichment".  It does not rely on
    a specific array technology (although the array should be a "tiling" array), is
    very general (can be applied in experiments resulting in regions of enrichment),
    and is very insensitive to array noise or normalization methods.  It is also very
    fast and can be applied on whole-genome tiling array experiments quite easily
    with enough memory.'
