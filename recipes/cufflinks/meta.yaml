  description: |
     Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests for
     differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It accepts aligned
     RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of
     transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these
     transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account
     biases in library preparation protocols.
