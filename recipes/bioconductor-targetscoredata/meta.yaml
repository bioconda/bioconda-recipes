  summary: 'Precompiled and processed miRNA-overexpression fold-changes from 84 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) series corresponding to 6 platforms, 77 human cells or tissues, and 113 distinct miRNAs. Accompanied with the data, we also included in this package the sequence feature scores from TargetScanHuman 6.1 including the context+ score and the probabilities of conserved targeting for each miRNA-mRNA interaction. Thus, the user can use these static sequence-based scores together with user-supplied tissue/cell-specific fold-change due to miRNA overexpression to predict miRNA targets using the package TargetScore (download separately)'
