  summary: 'Tests whether a set of counts fit a given expected ratio.
  For example, a genetic cross might be expected to produce four types
  in the relative frequencies of 9:3:3:1.
  To see whether a set of observed counts fits this expectation,
  one can examine all possible outcomes with xmulti()
  or a random sample of them with xmonte() and find the probability of
  an observation deviating from the expectation by
  at least as much as the observed. As a measure of deviation from the expected,
  one can use the log-likelihood ratio, the multinomial probability,
  or the classic chi-square statistic. A histogram of the test statistic can
  also be plotted and compared with the asymptotic curve.'
