  summary: Tests whether a set of counts fit a given expected ratio. For example, a genetic cross
    might be expected to produce four types in the relative frequencies of 9:3:3:1.
    To see whether a set of observed counts fits this expectation, one can examine all
    possible outcomes with xmulti() or a random sample of them with xmonte() and find
    the probability of an observation deviating from the expectation by at least as
    much as the observed. As a measure of deviation from the expected, one can use the
    log-likelihood ratio, the multinomial probability, or the classic chi-square statistic.
    A histogram of the test statistic can also be plotted and compared with the asymptotic
    curve.
