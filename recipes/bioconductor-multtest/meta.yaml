  summary: 'Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple testing
    procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for controlling the family-wise
    error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability
    of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR).  Several
    choices of bootstrap-based null distribution are implemented (centered, centered
    and scaled, quantile-transformed). Single-step and step-wise methods are available.
    Tests based on a variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based
    on regression parameters from linear and survival models as well as those based
    on correlation parameters) are included.  When probing hypotheses with t-statistics,
    users may also select a potentially faster null distribution which is multivariate
    normal with mean zero and variance covariance matrix derived from the vector influence
    function.  Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values, confidence regions
    and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly applicable to identifying
    differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.'
