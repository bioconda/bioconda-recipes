  summary: 'The Parallel Mixed Model (PMM) approach is suitable for hit selection and cross-comparison of RNAi screens generated in experiments that are performed in parallel under several conditions. For example, we could think of the measurements or readouts from cells under RNAi knock-down, which are infected with several pathogens or which are grown from different cell lines.'
