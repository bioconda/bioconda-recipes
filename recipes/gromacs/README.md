GROMACS versions are released in series, so we maintain one
recipe folder for each major version.

Be careful with the CI build time if updating multiple 
recipes, a single build takes about 1h12.

From http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2019/release-notes/index.html#gromacs-2019-series

> Major releases contain changes to the functionality supported, whereas patch releases contain only fixes for issues identified in the corresponding major releases.

> Two versions of GROMACS are under active maintenance, the 2019 series and the
> 2018 series. In the latter, only highly conservative fixes will be made, and
> only to address issues that affect scientific correctness. 

> Naturally, some of those releases will be made after the year 2018 ends, but
> we keep 2018 in the name so users understand how up to date their version is.
> Such fixes will also be incorporated into the 2019 release series, as
> appropriate. Around the time the 2020 release is made, the 2018 series will no
> longer be maintained.
