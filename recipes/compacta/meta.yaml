  summary: |
    Compacta is a software designed to reduce the number of contigs given by
    the assembler to a smaller set of representative sequences, preserving the
    information about relative expression given by the reads. Compacta output
    can then be employed in downstream analyses for contig identification and
    differential gene expression.
