  summary: "PanTools is a pangenomic toolkit for comparative analysis of large number of genomes."
  description: |
    PanTools is a pangenomic toolkit for comparative analysis of large number
    of genomes. It is developed in the Bioinformatics Group of Wageningen
    University, the Netherlands. Please cite the relevant publication(s) from
    the list of publications if you use PanTools in your research.

extra:
  notes: |
    PanTools is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper Python script.
    This wrapper is called "pantools" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "pantools -Xms512m -Xmx1g".
    NB: "pantools add_functions" currently doesn't work because of the expected
    directory structure by PanTools. We are looking into this.
    NB: For MacOS, BUSCO is **not** included in the dependency list but it is
    still required for one subcommand of pantools ("pantools busco_protein").
    Please manually install BUSCO for running this command.
