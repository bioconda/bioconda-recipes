  summary: 'This package provides functions for the integrated analysis of protein-protein
    interaction networks and the detection of functional modules. Different datasets
    can be integrated into the network by assigning p-values of statistical tests
    to the nodes of the network. E.g. p-values obtained from the differential expression
    of the genes from an Affymetrix array are assigned to the nodes of the network.
    By fitting a beta-uniform mixture model and calculating scores from the p-values,
    overall scores of network regions can be calculated and an integer linear programming
    algorithm identifies the maximum scoring subnetwork.'
