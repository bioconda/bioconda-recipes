  summary: 'GAGE is a published method for gene set (enrichment or GSEA) or pathway
    analysis. GAGE is generally applicable independent of microarray or RNA-Seq data
    attributes including sample sizes, experimental designs, assay platforms, and
    other types of heterogeneity, and consistently achieves superior performance over
    other frequently used methods. In gage package, we provide functions for basic
    GAGE analysis, result processing and presentation. We have also built pipeline
    routines for of multiple GAGE analyses in a batch, comparison between parallel
    analyses, and combined analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources/studies.
    In addition, we provide demo microarray data and commonly used gene set data based
    on KEGG pathways and GO terms. These funtions and data are also useful for gene
    set analysis using other methods.'
