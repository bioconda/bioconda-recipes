  summary: "Family Free Genome Comparison (FFGC) workflow"
  description: |
    Family Free Genome Comparison (FFGC) is a self-contained workflow system that
    provides functionality for all steps of a family-free gene order analysis
    starting from annotated genome sequences.
    
    Family-free methods for gene order analyses do not require prior knowledge of
    evolutionary relationships between the genes across the studied genomes. This
    tool features a complete workflow for genome comparison, requiring nothing
    but annotated genome sequences as input.
    
    Surprisingly, the continuous development of family-free methods recently lead
    to an integrated method for inferring gene families across several species.
    FFGC now includes a subworkflow for inferring gene families simultaneously
    based on gene similarities and family-free genome rearrangements (OrthoFFGCʜ
    and OrthoFFGCʜ≈ extensions).
    
    FFGC is available for download at our git repository
    (https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/gi/FFGC) or as a
    Conda package at Bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/ffgc).
    
    In general, three major steps are performed: (1) the computation of local
    sequence alignment scores between genes of two or more gene order sequences
    using BLAST+ or Diamond; (2) the establishment of gene relationships; and
    (3) the actual family-free gene order analysis.
