  summary: 'Secondary structure assignment'
  license: Boost
  description: >
    The DSSP program was designed by Wolfgang Kabsch and Chris Sander to
    standardize secondary structure assignment. DSSP is a database of secondary
    structure assignments (and much more) for all protein entries in the Protein
    Data Bank (PDB). DSSP is also the program that calculates DSSP entries from
    PDB entries. DSSP does not predict secondary structure.

    Note that this is a very old version of DSSP, which we have used in the
    past. It is kept here in the hope that others may find it useful - but
    it may not work on newer systems (e.g. Apple Silicon Macs). We recommend
    using the most recent version of DSSP instead.
    See [the DSSP website](http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/) for more details.

    If you have problems with this conda package, please
