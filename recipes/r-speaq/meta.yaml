  summary: We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis of NMR
    metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel peak alignment
    algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment (CluPA). The algorithm
    aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in a top-down fashion by building
    a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of reference and target spectra and
    then dividing the spectra into smaller segments based on the most distant clusters
    of the tree. To reduce the computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment,
    the method makes use of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) cross-correlation. Since
    the method returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology
    to study the variability of the NMR spectra. For each aligned NMR data point the
    ratio of the between-group and within-group sum of squares (BW-ratio) is calculated
    to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups of
    NMR spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of the F-statistic
    or a one-way ANOVA, but without distributional assumptions. Statistical inference
    based on the BW-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the null distribution from the
    experimental data. See Vu et al. (2011)<DOI:10.1186/1471-2105-12-405> for further
    information.
