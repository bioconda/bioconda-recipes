  summary: Makes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) data analysis as
    easy as possible by only requiring a small set of functions to perform an entire
    analysis. 'speaq' offers the possibility of raw spectra alignment and quantitation
    but also an analysis based on features whereby the spectra are converted to peaks
    which are then grouped and turned into features. These features can be processed
    with any number of statistical tools either included in 'speaq' or available elsewhere
    on CRAN. More detail can be found in <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-405> and <doi:10.1101/138503>.
