  description: >
    Dipcall is a reference-based variant calling pipeline for a pair of phased haplotype assemblies.
    It was originally developed for constructing the syndip benchmark dataset and has been applied to other phased assemblies, too.
    Dipcall can call small variants and long INDELs as long as they are contained in minimap2 alignment.
