  summary: RpsbProc, the post-RPSBLAST Processing Utility.
  description: |
    The rpsbproc command line utility is an addition to the standalone version of
    Reverse Position-Specific BLAST (RPS-BLAST), also known as CD-Search (Conserved
    Domain Search).

    It post-processes the results of local RPS-BLAST searches in order to provide a
    non-redundant view of the search results, and to provide additional annotation
    on query sequences, such as domain superfamilies and functional sites, similar to
    the annotation provided by the corresponding web services (e.g., the NCBI Batch
    CD-Search web service at
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/bwrpsb/bwrpsb.cgi).

    Specifically, the rpsbproc utility reads the output of rpsblast/rpstblastn,
    fills in domain superfamily and functional site information for each region of
    the sequence, re-sorts the hits by a different standard, and calculates a
    set of non-redundent representative hits. In this way, it turns the
    raw alignments into domain/site annotations on the query sequence at different
    redundancy level, basically produce the same data as web-based Batch CD-Search
    service does. The annotation data is presented in tab-delimited tables to be processed
    either programatically or manually with a spreadsheet (see details below).

    See the CDD and CD-Search help document for additional details about
    superfamilies, conserved sites, and more:
