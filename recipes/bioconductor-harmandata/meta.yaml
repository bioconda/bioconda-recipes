  summary: 'Data for the Harman package'
  description: 'Datasets of accompany Harman, a PCA and constrained optimisation based technique. Contains three example datasets: IMR90, Human lung fibroblast cells exposed to nitric oxide; NPM, an experiment to test skin penetration of metal oxide nanoparticles following topical application of sunscreens in non-pregnant mice; OLF; an experiment to gauge the response of human olfactory neurosphere-derived (hONS) cells to ZnO nanoparticles. Since version 1.24, this package also contains the Infinium5 dataset, a set of batch correction adjustments across 5 Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadChip datasets. This file does not contain methylation data, but summary statistics of 5 datasets after correction. There is also an EpiSCOPE_sample file as exampling for the new methylation clustering functionality in Harman.'
