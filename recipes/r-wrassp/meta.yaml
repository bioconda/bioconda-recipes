  summary: A wrapper around Michel Scheffers's libassp (Advanced Speech Signal Processor). The
    libassp library aims at providing functionality for handling speech signal files
    in most common audio formats and for performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech
    science. This includes the calculation of formants, fundamental frequency, root
    mean square, auto correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing rate,
    filtering etc. This wrapper provides R with a large subset of libassp's signal processing
    functions and provides them to the user in a (hopefully) user-friendly manner.
