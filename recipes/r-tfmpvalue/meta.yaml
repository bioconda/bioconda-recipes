  summary: In putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs)  identification from sequence/alignments,
    we are interested in the significance of certain match score. TFMPvalue provides
    the accurate calculation of P-value with  score threshold for Position Weight Matrices,  or
    the score with given P-value.  This package is an interface to code originally made
    available by  Helene Touzet and Jean-Stephane Varre, 2007,  Algorithms Mol Biol:2,
    15.
