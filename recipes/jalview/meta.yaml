  description: |
    Jalview is a free program for multiple sequence alignment editing, visualisation, analysis and figure generation.
    Use it to view and edit sequence alignments, analyse them with phylogenetic trees and principal
    components analysis (PCA) plots and explore molecular structures and annotation. It is also able
    to import and annotate DNA and Protein products from VCF files and retrieve data and annotation from
    Uniprot, Ensembl, ENA, Rfam, Pfam and the PDBe.

extra:
  notes: |
    This wrapper and installation is primarily for commandline-only use.
    Set JALVIEW_JRE=j1.8 or JALVIEW_JRE=j11 to specify the java runtime if you need jalview to start up as quickly as possible
    Set JALVIEW_MAXMEM=2g to restrict jalviews maximal memory consumption (here to 2G RAM). Otherwise 90% of physical memory
    (capped at 32G) is allocated.
