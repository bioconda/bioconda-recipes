  description: |
    ASTRAL is a tool for estimating an unrooted species tree given a set of unrooted gene trees. 
    ASTRAL is statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent model 
    (and thus is useful for handling incomplete lineage sorting, i.e., ILS). 
    ASTRAL finds the species tree that has the maximum number of shared induced 
    quartet trees with the set of gene trees, subject to the constraint that 
    the set of bipartitions in the species tree comes from a predefined set of bipartitions. 
    This predefined set is empirically decided by ASTRAL (but see tutorial on how to expand it). 
    The current code corresponds to ASTRAL-III.

extra:
  notes: 'astral is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper
    shell script. By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The
    command that runs the program is ''astral''. If you want to overwrite
    it you can specify memory options directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence. For example run it with ''biopet-fastqsplitter
    -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
