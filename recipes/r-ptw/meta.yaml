  summary: 'Parametric Time Warping aligns patterns, i.e. it aims to put corresponding features
    at the same locations. The algorithm searches for an optimal polynomial describing
    the warping. It is possible to align one sample to a reference, several samples
    to the same reference, or several samples to several references. One can choose
    between calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set of samples
    and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented: RMS (Root Mean Square
    error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both warping of peak profiles and of
    peak lists are supported.'
