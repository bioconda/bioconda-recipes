  summary: "Annotation helper tool for the manual curation of transposable element consensus sequences"
  description: |
    TE-Aid is a shell+R program aimed to help the manual curation of transposable 
    elements (TE). It inputs a TE consensus sequence (fasta format) and requires a 
    reference genome (in fasta as well). TE-Aid produces 4 figures reporting i) the genomic 
    hits with divergence to consensus, ii) the genomic coverage of the consensus, 
    iii) a self dot-plot, and iv) a structure analysis including TIR and LTR suggestions, 
    open reading frames (ORFs) and TE protein hit annotation.
