        - support for distributed computer systems
        - customizable error detection
        - manual intervention into workflow execution
        - GUI for workflow construction using pre-defined modules
        - a helper script for creating new module definitions
        - no restriction to specific programming languages
        - provides a flexible plugin system for extending without modifying the original sources
