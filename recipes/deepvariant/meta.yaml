{% set version="0.6.0" %}
# When updating, also need to update model reference in post-link.sh

package:
  name: deepvariant
  version: {{ version }}

# Things to work on:
# - Uses pre-built binaries, building problematic due to clif dependency
# - Need recent kernel with GLIBC > 2.23 due to pre-built htslib
# - Build patches __main__.py in zip files to generalize python dependency
# - Requires numpy 1.14, want to sync with CONDA_NPY
# - Uses python wrappers that don't expose all underlying options
# - Ships with pre-built model. Longer term will need way to fetch models on demand.
