  summary: 'Package for parsing Affymetrix files (CDF, CEL, CHP, BPMAP, BAR).  It
    provides methods for fast and memory efficient parsing of Affymetrix files using
    the Affymetrix'' Fusion SDK.  Both ASCII- and binary-based files are supported.  Currently,
    there are methods for reading chip definition file (CDF) and a cell intensity
    file (CEL).  These files can be read either in full or in part.  For example,
    probe signals from a few probesets can be extracted very quickly from a set of
    CEL files into a convenient list structure.'
