  summary: 'Assay characterization: estimation of limit of blanc(LoB) and limit of detection(LOD)'
  description: 'The MSstatsLOBD package allows calculation and visualization of limit of blac (LOB) and limit of detection (LOD). We define the LOB as the highest apparent concentration of a peptide expected when replicates of a blank sample containing no peptides are measured. The LOD is defined as the measured concentration value for which the probability of falsely claiming the absence of a peptide in the sample is 0.05, given a probability 0.05 of falsely claiming its presence. These functionalities were previously a part of the MSstats package. The methodology is described in Galitzine (2018) <doi:10.1074/mcp.RA117.000322>.'
