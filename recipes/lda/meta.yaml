    We present here a novel approach for for the identification of structural information of lipids. We achieve automated and reliable annotation of lipid species and their molecular structures in high-throughput data from chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry using decision rule sets embedded in Lipid Data Analyzer. Using various low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry instruments with several collision energies, we proved the method's platform independence. We propose that the softwareï¿½'s reliability, flexibility, and ability to identify novel lipid molecular species may now render current state-of-the-art lipid libraries obsolete.

    LDA is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "lda" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to override it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "lda -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
