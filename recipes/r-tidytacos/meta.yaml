  description: Tidytacos (tidy TAxonomic COmpositionS) is an R package for 
          the exploration of microbial community data. Such community data consists of read counts generated by amplicon 
          sequencing (e.g. a region of the 16S rRNA gene) or metagenome (shotgun) 
          sequencing. Each read count represents a number of sequencing reads identified 
          for some taxon (an ASV, OTU, species, or higher-level taxon) in a sample.
