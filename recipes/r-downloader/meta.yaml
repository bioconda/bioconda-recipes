  summary: 'Provides a wrapper for the download.file function, making it possible to download 
    files over HTTPS on Windows, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like platforms. The RCurl package 
    provides this functionality (and much more) but can be difficult to install because it must 
    be compiled with external dependencies. This package has no external dependencies, so it is 
    much easier to install.'
