# BUSCO needs a config file with paths to external dependencies. These deps are
# installed as runtime deps, but the paths in the config file need to reflect
# the current environment's $PREFIX/bin dir. BUSCO expects a config file in
# ../config/config.ini, so we create it here using sed on the default ini
# stored in the share dir, replacing paths as necessary.
