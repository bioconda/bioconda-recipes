  summary: BUSCO provides measures for quantitative assessment of genome
           assembly, gene set, and transcriptome completeness based on
           evolutionarily informed expectations of gene content from
           near-universal single-copy orthologs selected from OrthoDB.

extra:
  notes: An additional script, generate-busco-config.py, is installed with the package
         to generate a config file that has the correct paths to the dependencies
         used by busco that are also installed via conda.
