# Required to support Tensorflow v2.10, which is the only version
# supported by Medaka. The pinning of older versions of libcurl and
# openssl will cause installation of outdated packages and likely
# lead solver conflicts in the future. Please review this on future
# releases, especially if support for TensorFlow 2.11+ is added.
