# Required to support Tensorflow v2.10, which is the only version
# supported by Medaka. The pinning of older versions of libcurl will
# cause installation of outdated packages and likely lead conflicts
# in recipes in the future. Please review this on future releases of
# Medaka, especially if support for TensorFlow 2.11+ is added.
