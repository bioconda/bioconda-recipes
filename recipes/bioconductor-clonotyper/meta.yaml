  summary: 'High throughput analysis of T cell antigen receptor sequences'
  description: 'High throughput analysis of T cell antigen receptor sequences The genes encoding T cell receptors are created by somatic recombination, generating an immense combination of V, (D) and J segments. Additional processes during the recombination create extra sequence diversity between the V an J segments. Collectively, this hyper-variable region is called the CDR3 loop. The purpose of this package is to process and quantitatively analyse millions of V-CDR3-J combination, called clonotypes, from multiple sequence libraries.'
