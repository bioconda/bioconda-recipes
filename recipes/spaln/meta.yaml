  summary: 'Map and align a set of cDNA/EST or protein sequences onto a genome'
  description: |
    Spaln (space-efficient spliced alignment) is a stand-alone program that maps
    and aligns a set of cDNA or protein sequences onto a whole genomic sequence
    in a single job. Spaln also performs spliced or ordinary alignment after
    rapid similarity search against a protein sequence database, if a genomic segment 
    or an amino acid sequence is given as a query.
