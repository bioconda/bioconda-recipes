  summary: "Copy-number Haplotype Inference in Single-cell by Evolutionary Links"
  description: |
    CHISEL is an algorithm to infer allele- and haplotype-specififc copy numbers in individual cells from low-coverage
    single-cell DNA sequencing data. Specifically, the current implementation of CHISEL has been designed to be diretly
    applied to ultra-low coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data from 10X Genomics CNV solution, however CHISEL will
    be adapted to the data generated by any other available technology (e.g. DLP+).
