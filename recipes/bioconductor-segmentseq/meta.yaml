  summary: 'High-throughput sequencing technologies allow the production of large
    volumes of short sequences, which can be aligned to the genome to create a set
    of matches to the genome. By looking for regions of the genome which to which
    there are high densities of matches, we can infer a segmentation of the genome
    into regions of biological significance. The methods in this package allow the
    simultaneous segmentation of data from multiple samples, taking into account replicate
    data, in order to create a consensus segmentation. This has obvious applications
    in a number of classes of sequencing experiments, particularly in the discovery
    of small RNA loci and novel mRNA transcriptome discovery.'
