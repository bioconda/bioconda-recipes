  summary: 'R Interface to HDF5'
  description: 'This package provides an interface between HDF5 and R. HDF5''s main features are the ability to store and access very large and/or complex datasets and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage (disk) through a completely portable file format. The rhdf5 package is thus suited for the exchange of large and/or complex datasets between R and other software package, and for letting R applications work on datasets that are larger than the available RAM.'
