  summary: 'This R/Bioconductor package provides an interface between HDF5 and R.
    HDF5''s main features are the ability to store and access very large and/or complex
    datasets and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage (disk) through a completely
    portable file format. The rhdf5 package is thus suited for the exchange of large
    and/or complex datasets between R and other software package, and for letting
    R applications work on datasets that are larger than the available RAM.'
