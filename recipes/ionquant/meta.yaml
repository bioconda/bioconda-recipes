  summary: A label free quantification tool
  description: |
    IonQuant is a fast and comprehensive tool for MS1 precursor intensity-based quantification for timsTOF PASEF DDA and non-timsTOF (e.g., Orbitrap) data.
    It enables label-free quantification with false discovery (FDR) controlled match-between-runs (MBR).
    It can also be used for quantification in labelling-based experiments such as those involving SILAC, dimethyl, or similar labelling strategies.

    IonQuant is available freely for academic research and educational purposes only, in accordance with the terms at https://msfragger.arsci.com/upgrader/LICENSE-ACADEMIC.pdf.
