  summary: Computational pipeline for analysis of iCLIP data
  description: "# iCount: protein-RNA interaction analysis\n\niCount is a Python module and associated command-line interface (CLI),\nwhich provides all the commands needed to process iCLIP data on \nprotein-RNA\
    \ interactions and generate:\n \n+ demultiplexed and adapter-trimmed FASTQ files,\n+ BAM files with mapped iCLIP reads,\n+ identified protein-RNA cross-linked sites, saved to BED files,\n+ peaks composed\
    \ of statistically significant cross-linked sites, saved to BED files,\n+ clusters of significant cross-linked sites, saved to BED files,\n+ grouping of individual replicate experiments,\n+ RNAmap generation\
    \ showing the positional distribution of cross-linked sites relative to genomic landmarks,\n+ kmer enrichment analysis,\n+ and other.\n\nYou may start with the [tutorial](http://icount.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)\
    \ or dive into the \n[documentation](http://icount.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n\n\n## Authors\n\niCount is developed and supported by [Toma\u017E Curk](http://curk.info) from the \n[Bioinformatics\
    \ Laboratory](http://biolab.si) at the [University of Ljubljana](http://www.uni-lj.si), \n[Faculty of Computer and Information Science](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si) and in collaboration with \nthe laboratory\
    \ of [Jernej Ule](http://ulelab.info).\n\nThe development started in late 2008 when Toma\u017E Curk and Gregor Rot\nwrote a first prototype of iCount. In mid-2016, [Jure Zmrzlikar](https://github.com/JureZmrzlikar)\n\
    from [Genialis](http://www.genialis.com) helped refactoring and improving the code, \nwhich is now available here. For details and full acknowledgments,\nsee the [how to cite](http://icount.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cite.html)\
    \ section in the documentation.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions (pull requests) are welcome! Please submit your contributions by following the\n[guidelines](http://icount.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html).\n\
    \n\n## Reporting problems\n\nUse the [issues page](https://github.com/tomazc/iCount/issues) to report issues and request enhancements. Before submitting, please check the list of already reported issues.\
    \ Also, have a look at the [FAQ](http://icount.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html) to see if the problem has been addressed already."
