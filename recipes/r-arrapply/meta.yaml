  summary: 'High performance variant of apply() for a fixed set of functions. Considerable speedup
    is a trade-off for universality, user defined functions cannot be used with this
    package. However, 21 most currently employed functions are available for usage.
    They can be divided in three types: reducing functions (like mean(), sum() etc.,
    giving a scalar when applied to a vector), mapping function (like normalise(), cumsum()
    etc., giving a vector of the same length as the input vector) and finally, vector
    reducing function (like diff() which produces result vector of a length different
    from the length of input vector). Optional or mandatory additional arguments required
    by some functions (e.g. norm type for norm() or normalise() functions) can be passed
    as named arguments in ''...''.'
