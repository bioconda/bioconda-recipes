  summary: "Classify metagenomic contigs as eukaryotic or prokaryotic"
  description: |
    Whokaryote uses a random forest classifier that uses gene-structure based
    features and optionally Tiara predictions to predict whether a contig is
    from a eukaryote or from a prokaryote. You can use Whokaryote to determine
    which contigs need eukaryotic gene prediction and which need prokaryotic
    gene prediction.
