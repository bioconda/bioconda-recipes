  summary: Handle genomic data within data frames just as you would with 'GRanges'. This package
    provides methods to deal with genomic intervals the "tidy-way" which makes it simpler
    to integrate in the the general data munging process. The API is inspired by the
    popular 'bedtools' and the genome_join() method from the 'fuzzyjoin' package.
