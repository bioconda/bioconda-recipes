  notes: |
    biopet-scatterregions is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    By default 'no default java option' is set in the wrapper.
    The command that runs the program is 'biopet-scatterregions'.
    If you want to overwrite it you can specify memory options directly after your binaries.
    If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with 'biopet-scatterregions -Xms512m -Xmx1g'.
