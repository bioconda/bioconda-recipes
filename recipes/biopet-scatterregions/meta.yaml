extra:
  notes: 'biopet-scatterregions is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper
    shell script. By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The
    command that runs the program is ''biopet-scatterregions''. If you want to overwrite
    it you can specify memory options directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence. For example run it with ''biopet-scatterregions
    -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
