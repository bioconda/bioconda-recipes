  summary: 'An extension of the bigmemory package with added safety, convenience, and a factor class'
  description: 'This package defines a "BigMatrix" ReferenceClass which adds safety and convenience features to the filebacked.big.matrix class from the bigmemory package. BigMatrix protects against segfaults by monitoring and gracefully restoring the connection to on-disk data and it also protects against accidental data modification with a filesystem-based permissions system. We provide utilities for using BigMatrix-derived classes as assayData matrices within the Biobase package''s eSet family of classes. BigMatrix provides some optimizations related to attaching to, and indexing into, file-backed matrices with dimnames. Additionally, the package provides a "BigMatrixFactor" class, a file-backed matrix with factor properties.'
