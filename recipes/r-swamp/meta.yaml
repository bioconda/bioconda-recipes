  summary: 'Collection of functions to connect the structure of the data with the information
    on the samples. Three types of associations are covered: 1. linear model of principal
    components. 2. hierarchical clustering analysis. 3. distribution of features-sample
    annotation associations. Additionally, the inter-relation between sample annotations
    can be analyzed. Simple methods are provided for the correction of batch effects
    and removal of principal components.'
