  summary: 'An extremely memory-efficient hash_map implementation. 2 bits/entry overhead!
    The SparseHash library contains several hash-map implementations, including implementations
    that optimize for space or speed.  These hashtable implementations are similar
    in API to SGI''s hash_map class and the tr1 unordered_map class, but with different
    performance characteristics. It''s easy to replace hash_map or unordered_map by
    sparse_hash_map or dense_hash_map in C++ code.  They also contain code to serialize
    and unserialize from disk.'
