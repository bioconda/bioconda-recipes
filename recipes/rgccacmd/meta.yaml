    summary: 'Multiblock data analysis concerns the analysis of several sets of variables
        (blocks) observed on the same group of individuals. The main aims of the RGCCA
        package are: (i) to study the relationships between blocks and (ii) to identify
        subsets of variables of each block which are active in their relationships
        with the other blocks.'
