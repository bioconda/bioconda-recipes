  summary: 'Multiblock data analysis concerns the analysis of several sets of variables
        (blocks) observed on the same group of individuals. The main aims of the RGCCA
        package are (i) to study the relationships between blocks and (ii) to identify
        subsets of variables of each block which are active in their relationships
        with the other blocks.'
