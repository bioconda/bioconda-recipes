  description: |-
    ValidateAnnotationvalidates whether an annotation file is correct.
    It checks whether all the annotated contigs are present on the reference.
    It can check gtf or refflat files. It can also check both,
    in which case it will also check for dissimilarities between the refflat and
    GTF files.

extra:
  notes: 'biopet-validateannotation is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper
    shell script. By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The
    command that runs the program is ''biopet-validateannotation''. If you want to
    overwrite it you can specify memory options directly after your binaries. If you
    have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally this will take precedence. For example run it
    with ''biopet-validateannotation -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
