  summary: Translational Efficiency Regulation Analysis using the PADOG Method
  description: This package performs a Gene Set Analysis with the approach adopted by PADOG on the genes that are reported as translationally regulated (ie. exhibit a significant change in TE) by the DeltaTE package. It can be used on its own to see the impact of translation regulation on gene sets, but it is also integrated as an additional analysis method within ReactomeGSA, where results are further contextualised in terms of pathways and directionality of the change.
