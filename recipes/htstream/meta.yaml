  summary: |
    HTStream is a fast, quality control pipeline for Hight Throughput Sequencing data.
    The difference between HTStream and other pipelines is that HTStreams uses a tab delimited fastq format which allows for streaming from application to application.
    This streaming creates some awesome efficiencies when processing HTS data.
