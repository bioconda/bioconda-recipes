  summary: gkm-SVM, a sequence-based method for predicting regulatory DNA elements, is a useful tool for studying gene regulatory mechanisms. In continuous efforts to improve the method, new software, LS-GKM, is introduced. It offers much better scalability and provides further advanced gapped k-mer based kernel functions. As a result, LS-GKM achieves considerably higher accuracy than the original gkm-SVM.
