  summary: TINC is a package that implements algorithms to determine the contamination of a bulk
    sequencing sample in the context of cancer studies (matched tumour/ normal). The
    contamination estimated by TINC can be either due to normal cells sampled in the
    tumour biopsy or to tumour cells in the normal biopsy. The former case is traditionally
    called purity, or cellularity, and a number of tools exist to estimate it. The latter
    case is less common, and that is the main reason TINC has been developed. For this
    reason, the package takes name TINC, Tumour-in-Normal contamination. TINC is part
    of the evoverse, a package that gathers multiple R packages to implement Cancer
    Evolution analyses.
