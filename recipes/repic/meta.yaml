  summary:            REPIC - an ensemble learning approach to cryo-EM particle picking.
  description:        REPIC is an ensemble learning approach to cryogenic-electron\
    \ microscopy (cryo-EM) particle picking. It identifies particles common to\
    \ multiple picked particle sets (i.e., consensus particles) using graph\
    \ theory and integer linear programming (ILP). Picked particle sets may be\
    \ found by a human specialist (manual), template matching, mathematical\
    \ function (e.g., RELION's Laplacian-of-Gaussian auto-picking), or\
    \ machine-learning method. REPIC expects particle sets to be in BOX file\
    \ format (*.box) and contain particle coordinates, detection box size (in\
    \ pixels), and (optional) score [0-1].
