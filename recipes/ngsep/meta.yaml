  summary: NGSEP - Next Generation Sequencing Experience Platform
  description: |
    NGSEP provides an object model to enable different kinds of
    analysis of DNA high throughput sequencing (HTS) data. The classic
    use of NGSEP is a reference guided construction and downstream analysis of
    large datasets of genomic variation. NGSEP performs accurate detection and
    genotyping of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), small and large indels, short
    tandem repeats (STRs), inversions, and Copy Number Variants (CNVs). NGSEP also
    provides utilities for downstream analysis of variation in VCF files, including
    functional annotation of variants, filtering, format conversion, comparison,
    clustering, imputation, introgression analysis and different kinds of
    statistics.

  notes: |
    Version 4 includes new modules for read alignment and de-novo
    analysis of short and long reads including calculations of k-mers, error
    correction, de-novo analysis of Genotype-by-sequencing data and (coming soon)
    de-novo assembly of long read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data.
