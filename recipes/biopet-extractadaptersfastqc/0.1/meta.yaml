  description: |-
    ExtractAdaptersFastqc reads which adapter sequences where found from a FastQC raw report.
    These sequences can be used as input for a QC tool such as cutadapt.
    The sequences can be output in plain text format with a
    newline character as a separator between the sequences.
    Alternatively the sequences can be output in FASTA format.

extra:
  notes: 'biopet-extractadaptersfastqc is a Java program that comes with a custom
    wrapper shell script. By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper.
    The command that runs the program is ''biopet-extractadaptersfastqc''. If you
    want to overwrite it you can specify memory options directly after your binaries.
    If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally this will take precedence. For example
    run it with ''biopet-extractadaptersfastqc -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
