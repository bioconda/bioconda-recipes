  description: |
    AlphaFill is an algorithm based on sequence and structure similarity that “transplants” missing ligands, cofactors and (metal) ions to the AlphaFold models.
    By adding the molecular context to these protein structures, the models can be more easily appreciated in terms of function and structural integrity.
    Consequently, the AlphaFill models can be helpful in designing downstream wet-lab experiments and/or computational studies.
