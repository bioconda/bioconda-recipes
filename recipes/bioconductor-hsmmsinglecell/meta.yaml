  summary: 'Skeletal myoblasts undergo a well-characterized sequence of morphological
    and transcriptional changes during differentiation. In this experiment, primary
    human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM) were expanded under high mitogen conditions
    (GM) and then differentiated by switching to low-mitogen media (DM).  RNA-Seq
    libraries were sequenced from each of several hundred cells taken over a time-course
    of serum-induced differentiation. Between 49 and 77 cells were captured at each
    of four time points (0, 24, 48, 72 hours) following serum switch using the Fluidigm
    C1 microfluidic system. RNA from each cell was isolated and used to construct
    mRNA-Seq libraries, which were then sequenced to a depth of ~4 million reads per
    library, resulting in a complete gene expression profile for each cell.'
