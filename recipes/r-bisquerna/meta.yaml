  summary: Provides tools to accurately estimate cell type abundances  from heterogeneous bulk
    expression. A reference-based method utilizes single-cell information to generate
    a signature matrix and transformation of bulk expression for accurate regression
    based estimates. A marker-based method utilizes known cell-specific marker genes
    to measure relative abundances across samples. For more details, see Jew and Alvarez
    et al (2019) <doi:10.1101/669911>.
