  summary: a collection of Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs) for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
  description: " [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hemdag-tutorials/badge/?version=latest)](https://hemdag-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\nHEMDAG library:\n\
      * implements several Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs) for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs);\n\
      * can be used to reconcile flat predictions by considering the topology of the ontology;\n\
      * provides biologically consistent predictions according to the hierarchical nature of the ontology classes;\n\
      * is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical relationships of DAG-structured taxonomies, 
        such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO), but can be safely applied to tree-structured 
        taxonomies as well (e.g. FunCat), since trees are DAGs;\n\
      * scales nicely both in terms of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality of the examples;\n\
      * provides several utility functions to process and analyze graphs;\n\
      * provides several performance metrics to evaluate HEMs algorithms.\n\n "
