  summary: a collection of Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs) for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
  description: "[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hemdag/badge/?version=latest)](https://hemdag.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\nHEMDAG library:\n* implements several Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs) for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs);\n* reconciles flat predictions with the topology of the ontology;\n* can enhance predictions of virtually any flat learning methods by taking into account the hierarchical relationships between ontology classes;\n* provides biologically meaningful predictions that always obey the true-path-rule, the biological and logical rule that governs the internal coherence of biomedical ontologies;\n* is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical relationships of DAG-structured taxonomies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO), but can be safely applied to tree-structured taxonomies as well (e.g. FunCat), since trees are DAGs;\n* scales nicely both in terms of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality of the examples;\n* provides several utility functions to process and analyze graphs;\n* provides several performance metrics to evaluate HEMs algorithms.\n\n"
