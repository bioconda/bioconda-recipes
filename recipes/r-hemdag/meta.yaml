  summary: a collection of Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs) for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
  description: "[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hemdag-tutorials/badge/?version=latest)](https://hemdag-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n
    HEMDAG package
    - implements several Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs) for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs);\n
    - reconciles flat predictions with the topology of the ontology;\n
    - can enhance predictions of virtually any flat learning methods by taking into account the hierarchical relationships between ontology classes;\n
    - provides biologically meaningful predictions that always obey the 'true-path-rule', the biological and logical rule that governs the internal coherence of biomedical ontologies;\n
    - is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical relationships of DAG-structured taxonomies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO), but can be safely applied to tree-structured taxonomies as well (as FunCat), since trees are DAGs;\n
    - scales nicely both in terms of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality of the examples;\n
    - provides several utility functions to process and analyze graphs;\n
    - provides several performance metrics to evaluate HEMs algorithms\n"
