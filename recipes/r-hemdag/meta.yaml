  summary: An implementation of Hierarchical Ensemble Methods for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
    The 'HEMDAG' package can be used to enhance the predictions of virtually any flat
    learning methods, by taking into account the hierarchical nature of the classes
    of a bio-ontology. 'HEMDAG' is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical
    relationships of DAG-structured taxonomies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology
    (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO), but it can be also safely applied to tree-structured
    taxonomies (as FunCat), since trees are DAGs. 'HEMDAG' scale nicely both in terms
    of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality of the examples. (Marco
