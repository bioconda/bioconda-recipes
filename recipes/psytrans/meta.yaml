  summary: psytrans.py - Parasite & Symbiont Transcriptome Separation
  description: |
       psytrans.py separates the sequences of a host species from those of its main symbiont(s) or parasite(s) based on Support Vector Machine classification.
       The program takes as input a file in fasta format with the sequences to be classified.
       The program also requires a file with sequences of a species related to the host, and a file with sequences related to the symbiont (or parasite).
       The queries will be compared to these two files using BLASTX.
       Alternatively, the user can provide the output of pre-computed BLASTX searches (in tabular format: -outfmt 6 or 7).
       The classification is then carried out using the command line tools from libsvm.
