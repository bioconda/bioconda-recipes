# 'Autobrew' is being used by more and more packages these days
# to grab static libraries from Homebrew bottles. These bottles
# are fetched via Homebrew's --force-bottle option which grabs
# a bottle for the build machine which may not be macOS 10.9.
# Also, we want to use conda packages (and shared libraries) for
# these 'system' dependencies. See:
