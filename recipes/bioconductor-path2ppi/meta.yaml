  summary: 'Package to predict protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks in target organisms for which only a view information about PPIs is available. Path2PPI predicts PPI networks based on sets of proteins which can belong to a certain pathway from well-established model organisms. It helps to combine and transfer information of a certain pathway or biological process from several reference organisms to one target organism. Path2PPI only depends on the sequence similarity of the involved proteins.'
