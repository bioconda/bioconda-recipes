  summary: 'Allows for fast, correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient character string/text
    processing in every locale and any native encoding. Owing to the use of the ICU
    library, the package provides R users with platform-independent functions known
    to Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby programmers. Among available features there
    are: pattern searching (e.g., with ICU Java-like regular expressions or the Unicode
    Collation Algorithm), random string generation, case mapping, string transliteration,
    concatenation, Unicode normalization, date-time formatting and parsing, etc.'
