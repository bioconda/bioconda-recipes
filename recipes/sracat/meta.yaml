  summary: a command-line tool for extracting unordered read data from SRA files
  description:  |
    sracat is small C++ program that uses the NCBI sra-toolkit C++ API to
    extract sequence (and optionally quailty scores) from SRA records. Unlike
    the fasterq-dump program included with the sra-toolkit, sracat does not
    output the reads in their origianlly submitted order, but rather outputs
    reads in the order in which they are stored in the SRA file.
