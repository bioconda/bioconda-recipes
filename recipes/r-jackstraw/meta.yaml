  summary: Test for association between the observed data and their systematic patterns of variations.
    Systematic patterns may be captured by latent variables using principal component
    analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), and related methods. The jackstraw enables
    statistical testing for association between observed variables and latent variables,
    as captured by PCs or other estimates. Similarly, unsupervised clustering, such
    as K-means clustering, partition around medoids (PAM), and others, finds subpopulations
    among the observed variables. The jackstraw estimates statistical significance of
    cluster membership, including unsupervised evaluation of cell identities in single
    cell RNA-seq. P-values and posterior probabilities allows one to rigorously evaluate
    the strength of cluster membership assignments.
