  summary: 'Imports transcript-level abundance, estimated counts and transcript lengths,
    and summarizes into matrices for use with downstream gene-level analysis packages.
    Average transcript length, weighted by sample-specific transcript abundance estimates,
    is provided as a matrix which can be used as an offset for different expression
    of gene-level counts.'
