  summary: 'To infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge into  bioinformatics research  area. In order to detect dependencies between genes at different time delays, we propose an  approach  to  infer  gene  regulatory  networks  from  time-series measurements starting from a well known algorithm based on information theory. The proposed algorithm is expected to  be useful in reconstruction of small biological directed networks from time course data.'
