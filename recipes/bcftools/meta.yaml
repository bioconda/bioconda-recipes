  summary: BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant
    Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work transparently
    with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.  Most commands
    accept VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype detected automatically even when
    streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF will work in all situations. Un-indexed
    VCF and BCF and streams will work in most, but not all situations.
