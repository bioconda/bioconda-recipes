  summary: This framework allows you to design and implement complex pipelines, and deploy them
    on your institution's computing cluster. This has been built keeping in mind the
    needs of bioinformatics workflows. However, it is easily extendable to any field
    where a series of steps (shell commands) are to be executed in a (work)flow.
