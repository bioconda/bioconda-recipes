  summary: |
    Dollo-CDP is a method for estimating phylogenies from character data under the Dollo parsimony criterion score. The input characters must be ordered, with 0 representing the ancestral state and 1 representing the mutated or derived state. Under the Dollo assumption, there can be exactly one forward mutation (0->1) per character, however, there can be any number of backward mutations (1->0); this assumption is popular for analyzing low-homoplasy characters evolving within a population genetics framework (i.e., where there is ILS) as well as in tumor phylogenetics. Our approach is novel in that it is guaranteed to return an optimal solution to the Dollo parsimony problem that obeys the set of constraints (clades) given as input. These constraints can be generated automatically from the character data or via a previous heuristic search, as described in this example. To learn more about Dollo-CDP, check out the related paper in the WABI 2023 proceedings.
