# These are almost the same python values as the bioconda conda_build_config.yaml:
# https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-utils/blob/master/bioconda_utils/bioconda_utils-conda_build_config.yaml
#
# The difference is '*cpython' instead of '*_cpython'.
# It should restrict to the same versions.
#
# Since the strings are distinct from what is in the conda-forge
# conda_build_config.yaml, the intersection of python values from the
# multiple configs is empty. This avoids the unwanted behavior of conda build
# taking the intersection of the python specifications from the bioconda and
# the conda-forge conda_build_config.yaml files (instead of letting the
# bioconda config override the conda-forge config).

# conda-forge config:
