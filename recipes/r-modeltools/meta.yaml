  summary: A collection of tools to deal with statistical models.  The functionality is experimental
    and the user interface is likely to change in the future. The documentation is rather
    terse, but packages `coin' and `party' have some working examples. However, if you
    find the implemented ideas interesting we would be very interested in a discussion
    of this proposal. Contributions are more than welcome!
