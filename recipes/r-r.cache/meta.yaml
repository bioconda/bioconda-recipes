  summary: !!python/unicode 'Memoization can be used to speed up repetitive and computational
    expensive function calls.  The first time a function that implements memoization
    is called the results are stored in a cache memory.  The next time the function
    is called with the same set of parameters, the results are momentarily retrieved
    from the cache avoiding repeating the calculations.  With this package, any R object
    can be cached in a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary set of R
    objects.  The cache memory is persistent (on the file system).'
