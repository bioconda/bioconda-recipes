  summary: 'FASTX::Abi - Read Sanger trace file (.ab1 chromatograms) in FASTQ format. For traces called with hetero option, the ambiguities will be split into two sequences to allow usage from NGS tools that usually do not understand IUPAC ambiguities. '

  description: |
    This module reads a Sanger trace (chromatogram). If the chromatogram was saved in "hetero" mode, that is allowing IUPAC
    ambiguities in the basecalling, the module will return two (unphased) sequences in standard "ACGT" alphabet.
