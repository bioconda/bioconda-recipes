  summary: An implementation of extensions to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's
    gradient boosting machine. Includes regression methods for least squares, absolute
    loss, t-distribution loss, quantile regression, logistic, multinomial logistic,
    Poisson, Cox proportional hazards partial likelihood, AdaBoost exponential loss,
    Huberized hinge loss, and Learning to Rank measures (LambdaMart).
