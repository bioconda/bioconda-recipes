  summary: "assembly-assisted tool for un-supervised metagenomic binning"
  description: |
    MetaProb is a novel assembly-assisted tool for un-supervised metagenomic
    binning. The novelty of MetaProb derives from solving a few important
    problems: how to divide reads into groups of independent reads, so that
    l-mer frequencies are not overestimated; how to convert l-mer counts into
    probabilistic sequence signatures, that will correct for variable
    distribution of l-mers, and for unbalanced groups of reads, in order to
    produce better estimates of the underlying genome statistic. We show that
    MetaProb is effective for both simulated and real datasets. It can
    accurately (with F-measures of 87 for short reads and 97 long reads) and
    efficiently bin short and long reads with varying abundance ratios.
