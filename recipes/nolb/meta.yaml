  summary: NOn-Linear rigid Block NMA approach (NOLB) is a conceptually simple and computationally efficient method for non-linear normal mode analysis.
  description: The key observation of the method is that the angular velocity of a residue can be interpreted as the result of an implicit force, such that the motion of the residue can be considered as a pure rotation about a certain center.
