  summary: 'Increasingly powerful techniques for high-throughput sequencing open the possibility
    to comprehensively characterize microbial communities, including rare species. However,
    a still unresolved issue are the substantial error rates in the experimental process
    generating these sequences. To overcome these limitations we propose an approach,
    where each sample is split and the same amplification and sequencing protocol is
    applied to both halves. This procedure should allow to detect likely PCR and sequencing
    artifacts, and true rare species by comparison of the results of both parts. The
    AmpliconDuo package, whereas amplicon duo from here on refers to the two amplicon
    data sets of a split sample, is intended to help interpret the obtained read frequency
    distribution across split samples, and to filter the false positive reads.'
