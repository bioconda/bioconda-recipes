about:
  description: This package provides a roclet for roxygen2 that identifies and processes code blocks in your documentation marked with `@longtests`. These blocks should contain tests that take a long time to run and thus cannot be included in the regular test suite of the package. When you run `roxygen2::roxygenise` with the `longtests_roclet`, it will extract these long tests from your documentation and save them in a separate directory. This allows you to run these long tests separately from the rest of your tests, for example, on a continuous integration server that is set up to run long tests.
