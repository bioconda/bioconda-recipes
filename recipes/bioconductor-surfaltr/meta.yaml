  summary: 'Rapid Comparison of Surface Protein Isoform Membrane Topologies Through surfaltr'
  description: 'Cell surface proteins form a major fraction of the druggable proteome and can be used for tissue-specific delivery of oligonucleotide/cell-based therapeutics. Alternatively spliced surface protein isoforms have been shown to differ in their subcellular localization and/or their transmembrane (TM) topology. Surface proteins are hydrophobic and remain difficult to study thereby necessitating the use of TM topology prediction methods such as TMHMM and Phobius. However, there exists a need for bioinformatic approaches to streamline batch processing of isoforms for comparing and visualizing topologies. To address this gap, we have developed an R package, surfaltr. It pairs inputted isoforms, either known alternatively spliced or novel, with their APPRIS annotated principal counterparts, predicts their TM topologies using TMHMM or Phobius, and generates a customizable graphical output. Further, surfaltr facilitates the prioritization of biologically diverse isoform pairs through the incorporation of three different ranking metrics and through protein alignment functions.
