NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY ELSEWHERE IN THIS 
AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY PORTION OF THE MATERIALS, AND THE 
APPLICATION AND/OR PRODUCT DEVELOPED BY YOU MAY ONLY BE USED FOR 
EVALUATION PURPOSES AND ONLY FOR THE TERM OF THE EVALUATION.  You may 
install copies of the Materials on a reasonable number of computers to conduct
your evaluation provided that you are the only individual using the Materials 
and only one copy of the Materials is in use at any one time.  A separate 
license is required for each additional use and/or individual user in all other
cases, including without limitation, use by persons, computer systems, and other
use methods known now and in the future.  Intel may provide you with a license 
code key that enables the Materials for an evaluation license.  If you are an 
entity, Intel grants you the right to designate one individual within your 
organization to have the sole right to use the Materials in the manner 
provided above.

iii.	NONCOMMERCIAL-USE LICENSE:  If you are using the Materials under the 
control of a noncommercial-use license, if you are an individual, you as an 
individual may use the Materials only for non-commercial use where you receive 
no fee, salary or any other form of compensation.  The Materials may not be used
for any other purpose, whether "for profit" or "not for profit."  Any work 
performed or produced as a result of use of the Materials cannot be performed 
or produced for the benefit of other parties for a fee, compensation or any 
other 
reimbursement or remuneration.  You may install copies of the Materials on an 
unlimited number of computers provided that you are the only individual using 
the Materials and only one copy of the Materials is in use at any one time.  
A separate license is required for each additional use and/or individual user 
in all other cases, including without limitation, use by persons, computer 
systems, and other methods of use known now and in the future.  Intel will 
provide you with a license code key that enables the Materials for a 
noncommercial-use license.  If you obtained a time-limited noncommercial-use 
license, the duration (time period) of your license and your ability to use the 
Materials is limited to the time period of the obtained license, which is 
controlled by the license key code for the Materials.  If you are an entity, 
Intel grants you the right to designate one individual within your organization 
to have the sole right to use the Materials in the manner provided above.

iv.	SINGLE-USER LICENSE: If you are using the Materials under the control 
of a single-user license, you as an individual may install and use the Materials
on an unlimited number of computers provided that you are the only individual 
using the Materials and only one copy of the Materials is in use at any one 
time.  A separate license is required for each additional use and/or individual 
user in all other cases, including without limitation, use by persons, computer 
systems, and other methods of use known now and in the future.  Intel will 
provide you with a license code key that enables the Materials for a single-user
license.  If you obtained a time-limited single-user license, the term of your 
license and your ability to use the Materials is limited to the specified time 
period, which is controlled by the license key code for the Materials.  If you 
are an entity, Intel grants you the right to designate one individual within 
your organization to have the sole right to use the Materials in the manner 
provided above.

v.	NODE-LOCKED LICENSE: If you are using the Materials under the control of
 a node-locked license, you may use the Materials only on a single designated 
computer by no more than the authorized number of concurrent users.  A separate 
license is required for each additional concurrent user and use, and/or computer
systems in all other cases, including without limitation, use by persons, 
computer systems, and other methods of use known now and in the future.  Intel 
will provide you with a license code key that enables the Materials for a Node-
Locked license up to the authorized number of concurrent users.  If you obtained
a time-limited node-locked license, the term of your license and your ability to
use the Materials is limited to the specified time, which is controlled by the 
license key code for the Materials.

vi.	FLOATING LICENSE: If you are using the Materials under the control of a 
floating license, you may (a) install the Materials on an unlimited number of 
computers that are connected to the designated network and (b) use the Material 
by no more than the authorized number of concurrent individual users.  
A separate license is required for each additional concurrent individual user 
and each additional use by a computer system and/or network on which the 
Materials are used. You understand that you must obtain a  separate license for 
every and any use of the Materials under a floating license, regardless of 
whether such use is, without limitation, by persons, computer systems, and other
methods of use known now and in the future.  Intel will provide you with a 
license code key that enables the Materials for a floating license up to the 
authorized number of concurrent users.  If you obtained a time-limited Floating 
license, the duration (time period) of your license and your ability to use the 
Materials is limited to the time period of the obtained license, which is 
controlled by the license key code for the Materials.  Intel Library Floating 
License: If the Materials are the Intel(R) Math Kernel Library or the Intel(R) 
Integrated Performance Primitives Library or the Intel(R) Threading Building 
Blocks (either "Intel Library"), then the Intel Library is provided to you as an
add-on option to either the Intel(R) C++ Compiler product or the Intel(R) 
Fortran Compiler product (either, an "Intel Compiler") for which you have a 
Floating license, and as such, in addition to the terms and conditions above, 
the Intel Library may only be used by the authorized concurrent users (as noted 
above) of that Intel Compiler Floating license.

SQLite, http://www.sqlite.org/

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the
public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of
the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their
contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed
affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of
Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or
distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as
a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and
by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and
documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you
actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used
as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts
generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source
licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final
deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated
with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to
copy and use the SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from
scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open
internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original
author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on
file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with
licensed code from other projects.
