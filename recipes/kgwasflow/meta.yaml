  summary: "kGWASflow is a Snakemake workflow for performing k-mers-based GWAS."
  description: |
      kGWASflow is a Snakemake pipeline developed for performing k-mers-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on the method by Voichek et al. (2020). 
      It performs several pre-GWAS analysis including read trimming, quality control and k-mer counting. It implements the kmersGWAS method worfklow for performing k-mers-based GWAS. 
      The pipeline also contains post-GWAS analysis, such as mapping k-mers to a reference genome, finding source reads of k-mers, assembling source reads of k-mers and mapping them to a reference genome. 
      kGWASflow is highly customizable, presenting users with an array of options to select from based on their unique requirements.
