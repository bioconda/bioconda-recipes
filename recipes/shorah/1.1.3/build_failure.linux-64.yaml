                    [-a FLOAT] [-x INT] [-s FLOAT]

  Local haplotype reconstruction - amplicon mode

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  Input files:
    Required input

    -b BAM, --bam BAM     file with aligned reads in .bam format (default: None)
    -f REF, --fasta REF   reference genome in fasta format (default: None)

  Type of run:
    You can specify a region, or look for the highest diversity region

    -r chrm:start-stop, --region chrm:start-stop
                          region in format 'chrm:start-stop' e.g.
                          'ch3:1000-1300' (default: )
    -d, --diversity       if set, automatically detects the highest entropy
                          region and runs there (default: False)

  Run options:
    Fine tuning

    -m FLOAT, --min_overlap FLOAT
                          fraction of read overlap to be included (default:
                          0.95)
    -a FLOAT, --alpha FLOAT
                          alpha in dpm sampling (default: 0.5)

  More options:
    Do you really want to change this?

    -x INT, --maxcov INT  approximate max coverage allowed (default: 50000)
    -s FLOAT, --sigma FLOAT
                          sigma value to use when calling SNVs (default: 0.01)
