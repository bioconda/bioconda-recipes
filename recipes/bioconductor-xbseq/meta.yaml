  summary: 'We developed a novel algorithm, XBSeq, where a statistical model was established
    based on the assumption that observed signals are the convolution of true expression
    signals and sequencing noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic regions are considered
    as sequencing noises, which follows a Poisson distribution. Given measureable
    observed and noise signals from RNA-seq data, true expression signals, assuming
    governed by the negative binomial distribution, can be delineated and thus the
    accurate detection of differential expressed genes.'
