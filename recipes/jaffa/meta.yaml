  summary: |
    JAFFA is a multi-step pipeline that takes either raw RNA-Seq reads, or pre-assembled transcripts then searches
    for gene fusions.  This package contains the wrappers jaffa-direct, jaffa-assembly, and jaffa-hybrid.
    You can pass the "refSeq" parameter in the environment variables JAFFA_REF_BASE. Otherwise, pass any paramters
    to the wrappers as you would to the bpipe JAFFA_{method} call in the manual.
