  summary: 'An optimised re-implementation of the call-methylation and eventalign modules in Nanopolish. Given a set of basecalled Nanopore reads and the raw signals, f5c call-methylation detects the methylated cytosine and f5c eventalign aligns raw nanopore DNA signals (events) to the base-called read.'
