  description: |
        Snakemake is a workflow management system that aims to reduce the complexity of creating 
        workflows by providing a fast and comfortable execution environment, together with a clean 
        and modern specification language in python style. Snakemake workflows are essentially Python 
        scripts extended by declarative code to define rules. Rules describe how to create output 
        files from input files.
