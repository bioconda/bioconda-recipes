    about:
      description: |
        Snakemake is a workflow management system that aims to reduce the complexity
        of creating workflows by providing a fast and comfortable execution 
        environment, together with a clean and modern specification language in 
        python style. Snakemake workflows are essentially Python scripts extended 
        by declarative code to define rules. Rules describe how to create output 
        files from input files. This package provides the core snakemake functionality.
        For features like reports and remote files, check out the snakemake package 
        which provides all optional dependencies.
