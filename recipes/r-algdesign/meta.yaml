  summary: Algorithmic experimental designs. Calculates exact and approximate theory experimental
    designs for D,A, and I criteria. Very large designs may be created. Experimental
    designs may be blocked or blocked designs created from a candidate list, using several
    criteria.  The blocking can be done when whole and within plot factors interact.
