  summary: Toolkit for Population Genetic Statistics from Pool-Sequenced Samples, e.g., in Evolve and Resequence experiments
  description: |
    grenedalf is a collection of commands for working with population genetic data, in particular from pool sequencing.
    Its main focus are statistical analyses such as Tajima's D and Fst. The statistics follow the approaches of PoPoolation
    and PoPoolation2, as well as poolfstat and npstat. However, compared to those, grenedalf is significantly more scalable,
    more user friendly, and offers more settings and input file formats.
