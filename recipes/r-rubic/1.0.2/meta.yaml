  summary: 'RUBIC detects recurrent copy number aberrations using copy number
    breaks, rather than recurrently amplified or deleted regions. This allows
    for a vastly simplified approach as recursive peak splitting procedures and
    repeated re-estimation of the background model are avoided. Furthermore,
    the false discovery rate is controlled on the level of called regions,
    rather than at the probe level.'
