  summary: 'A genome informatics project for Evidence Directed Gene Construction for Eukaryotes'
  description: |
    EvidentialGene is a genome informatics project for "Evidence Directed Gene Construction for Eukaryotes", 
    for constructing high quality, accurate gene sets for animals and plants (any eukaryotes), being developed 
    by Don Gilbert at Indiana University, gilbertd at indiana edu. The perl scripts are nested inside the 
    'scripts' folder and, therefor can only be used by providing the full path 
    such as '$EVIGENEHOME/scripts/prot/tr2aacds.pl -h'
