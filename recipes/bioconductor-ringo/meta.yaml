  summary: 'The package Ringo facilitates the primary analysis of ChIP-chip data.
    The main functionalities of the package are data read-in, quality assessment,
    data visualisation and identification of genomic regions showing enrichment in
    ChIP-chip. The package has functions to deal with two-color oligonucleotide microarrays
    from NimbleGen used in ChIP-chip projects, but also contains more general functions
    for ChIP-chip data analysis, given that the data is supplied as RGList (raw)  or
    ExpressionSet (pre- processed). The package employs functions from various other
    packages of the Bioconductor project and provides additional ChIP-chip-specific
    and NimbleGen-specific functionalities.'
