15.	This Agreement and the license rights granted herein shall become effective as of the date the user downloaded the Licensed Software and shall continue in full force until the user deletes the Licensed Software and any and all related files from the user’s computing system, unless terminated in accordance with this Section. Upon one party's breach of any agreement, covenant, or representation made in this Agreement, the agreement will automatically end thirty (30) days after such breach.
