  summary: The Kruskal and Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks  or van der Waerden's
    normal score test can be employed,  if the data do not meet the assumptions  for
    one-way ANOVA. Provided that significant differences  were detected by the omnibus
    test, one may be interested  in applying post-hoc tests for pairwise multiple comparisons  (such
    as Nemenyi's test, Dunn's test, Conover's test, van der Waerden's test). Similarly,
    one-way ANOVA with repeated  measures that is also referred to as ANOVA with unreplicated  block
    design can also be conducted via the Friedman-Test  or the Quade-test. The consequent
    post-hoc pairwise  multiple comparison tests according to Nemenyi, Conover and Quade
    are also provided in this package. Finally Durbin's test for  a two-way balanced
    incomplete block design (BIBD) is also given in this package.
