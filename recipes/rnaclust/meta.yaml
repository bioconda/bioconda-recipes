  summary: 'A tool for clustering of RNAs based on their secondary structures using LocARNA'
  description: |
    RNAclust is a perl script summarizing all the single steps required for
    clustering of structured RNA motifs, i.e. identifying groups of RNA
    sequences sharing a secondary structure motif. It requires as input a
    multiple FASTA file. In the first step for each input sequence the base
    pair probability matrix of its secondary structure distribution is
    calculated (using RNAfold from the Vienna RNA package). Secondly, for
    each pair of base pair probability matrices a sequence-structure alignment
    is calculated using LocARNA. Lastly, a hierarchical cluster-tree (in
    NEWICK format) is derived by WPGMA clustering of the pairwise alignment
    distances and the optimal number of clusters is calculated from the tree.
