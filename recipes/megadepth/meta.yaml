  summary: Megadepth is an efficient tool for extracting coverage related information from RNA and DNA-seq BAM and BigWig files.
           It supports reading whole-genome coverage from BAM files and writing either indexed TSV or BigWig files, as well as
           efficient region coverage summary over intervals from both types of files.
