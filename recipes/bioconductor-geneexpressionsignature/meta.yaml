  summary: 'This package gives the implementations of the gene expression signature and its distance to each. Gene expression signature is represented as a list of genes whose expression is correlated with a biological state of interest. And its distance is defined using a nonparametric, rank-based pattern-matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Gene expression signature and its distance can be used to detect similarities among the signatures of drugs, diseases, and biological states of interest.'
