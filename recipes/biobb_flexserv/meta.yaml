  summary: Biobb_flexserv is the Biobb module collection for biomolecular flexibility studies on protein 3D structures.
  description: "biobb_flexserv allows the generation of protein conformational ensembles from 3D structures and the analysis of its molecular flexibility. It is based on the work included in the FlexServ server (https://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/FlexServ/, Camps et. al., FlexServ: an integrated tool for the analysis of protein flexibility, Bioinformatics, Volume 25, Issue 13, 1 July 2009, Pages 1709â€“1710, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp304).\nBiobb (BioExcel building blocks) packages are Python\
    \ building blocks that\ncreate new layer of compatibility and interoperability over popular\n
    \ bioinformatics tools.\nThe latest documentation of this package can be found in our readthedocs site: http://biobb_vs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n"
