  summary: 'TWGBS and RNA-seq data from tissue T regulatory cells from mice'
  description: 'The package provides ready to use epigenomes (obtained from TWGBS) and transcriptomes (RNA-seq) from various tissues as obtained in the study (Delacher and Imbusch 2017, PMID: 28783152). Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) perform two distinct functions: they maintain self-tolerance, and they support organ homeostasis by differentiating into specialized tissue Treg cells. The underlying dataset characterises the epigenetic and transcriptomic modifications for specialized tissue Treg cells.'
