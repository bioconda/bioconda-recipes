  summary: PneumoCaT (Pneumococcal Capsular Typing) uses a two-step step approach
    to assign capsular type to S.pneumoniae genomic data (Illumina)

description: |-
  In the first step, reads from each readset are mapped to capsular locus sequences for all known capsular types (92 for S. pneumoniae plus 2 additional subtypes/molecular types).
  This step is considered successful if the readset matches > 90% to 1 or more capsular locus sequences.
  If it matches to a single capsular locus then PneumoCaT terminates here and reports this as the assigned capsular type.
  If more than 1 loci are matched then the tool moves to the second step; a variant based approach that utilises the capsular type variant (CTV) database to distinguish serotypes within a serogroup/genogroup.
  For more information you can refer to the publication.
