  summary: "Fast algorithm for computing molecular surfaces"
  description: |
    MSMS is a fast algorithm for computing molecular surfaces.
    It was developed by Dr. Michel F. Sanner as part of his PhD thesis.
    It has been widely used for computing and displaying Solvent Excluded Surfaces for proteins.
    MSMS is used by various molecular visualization programs including VMD, Chimera, and PMV.
