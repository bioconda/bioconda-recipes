  summary: "Command line NoD (clinod), for  predicting nucleolar localization sequences."

test:
  commands:
    - clinod | grep -i "^NucleOlar localization sequence Detector"
    # Expect:
    # NucleOlar localization sequence Detector v. 1.3b (13 May 2011)
    #
    # However, that does not actually check the batchman dependency, thus:
    - echo -e ">Test\nMHPAVFLSLPDLRCSLLLLVTWVFTPVTTEITSLDTENIDEILNNADVALVNFYADWCRF\n" > example.fasta && clinod -in=example.fasta -f=MEDIUM_TAB -nonols -clean_sequence
    # Expect:
    # #ID	      Start			    End		  NOLS

  notes: |
    Command line NoD (clinod) is Java program which is packaged with a custom
    wrapper shell script. This shell wrapper is called "clinod" and is on $PATH
    by default. By default "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want
    to overwrite it you can specify these values directly after your binaries.
    If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "clinod -Xms512m -Xmx1g ..."
