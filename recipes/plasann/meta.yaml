  summary: 'Plasmid Annotation Pipeline'
  description: |
    A comprehensive tool for annotating plasmid sequences, identifying coding
    sequences, detecting origins of replication and transfer, and generating
    plasmid maps.
    
    IMPORTANT: This package requires BLAST and Prodigal to be installed separately:
    
    For Linux/Windows/Intel Macs:
    conda install -c bioconda blast prodigal
    
    For Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs:
    brew install blast
    brew install brewsci/bio/prodigal
    
    Please ensure both tools are available in your PATH before running PlasAnn.

extra:
  notes: |
    This package requires external dependencies (BLAST and Prodigal) which must be
    installed separately due to platform compatibility issues, especially on macOS
    with Apple Silicon (M1/M2).
