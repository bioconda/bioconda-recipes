  summary: 'Infer the posterior distributions of microRNA targets by probabilistically
    modelling the likelihood microRNA-overexpression fold-changes and sequence-based
    scores. Variaitonal Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is applied to log
    fold-changes and sequence scores to obtain the posteriors of latent variable being
    the miRNA targets. The final targetScore is computed as the sigmoid-transformed
    fold-change weighted by the averaged posteriors of target components over all
    of the features.'
