  summary: 'A collection of algorithms and functions to aid statistical modeling.
    Includes growth curve comparisons, limiting dilution analysis (aka ELDA), mixed
    linear models, heteroscedastic regression, inverse-Gaussian probability calculations,
    Gauss quadrature and a secure convergence algorithm for nonlinear models.  Includes
    advanced generalized linear model functions that implement secure convergence, dispersion
    modeling and Tweedie power-law families.'
