  summary: 'qusage: Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene Expression'
  description: 'This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) method described in (Yaari G. et al, Nucl Acids Res, 2013). This is a novel Gene Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed to provide a faster, more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene expression studies. qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations using the Variance Inflation Factor technique proposed by Wu et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition, rather than simply evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a complete probability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P values and confidence intervals can be easily extracted. Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g., pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining statistical traceability. Finally, while qusage is compatible with individual gene statistics from existing methods (e.g., LIMMA), a Welch-based method is implemented that is shown to improve specificity. The QuSAGE package also includes a mixed effects model implementation, as described in (Turner JA et al, BMC Bioinformatics, 2015), and a meta-analysis framework as described in (Meng H, et al. PLoS Comput Biol. 2019). For questions, contact Chris Bolen (cbolen1@gmail.com) or Steven Kleinstein (steven.kleinstein@yale.edu)'
