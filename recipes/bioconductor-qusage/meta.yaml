  summary: 'This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene
    Expression (QuSAGE) method described in (Yaari G. et al, Nucl Acids Res, 2013).
    This is a novel Gene Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed to provide a
    faster, more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene expression studies.
    qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations using the Variance Inflation Factor
    technique proposed by Wu et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition, rather
    than simply evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single number
    (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a complete probability density
    function (PDF). From this PDF, P values and confidence intervals can be easily
    extracted. Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g., pair-wise
    comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining statistical traceability.
    Finally, while qusage is compatible with individual gene statistics from existing
    methods (e.g., LIMMA), a Welch-based method is implemented that is shown to improve
    specificity. For questions, contact Chris Bolen (cbolen1@gmail.com) or Steven
    Kleinstein (steven.kleinstein@yale.edu)'
