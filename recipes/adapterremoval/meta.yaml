  summary: 'This program searches for and removes remnant adapter sequences from High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and (optionally) trims low quality bases from the 3 end of reads following adapter removal. AdapterRemoval can analyze both single end and paired end data, and can be used to merge overlapping paired-ended reads into (longer) consensus sequences. Additionally, the AdapterRemoval may be used to recover a consensus adapter sequence for paired-ended data, for which this information is not available. For comments, suggestions and feedback please contact Mikkel Schubert (MikkelSch@gmail.com) and Stinus Lindgreen (stinus@binf.ku.dk). If you use AdapterRemoval v2, then please cite the paper: Schubert, Lindgreen, and Orlando (2016). AdapterRemoval v2: rapid adapter trimming, identification, and read merging.
