  summary: A lightweight CAZyme annotation tool
  description: |
    Dbcanlight is a lightweight rewrite of a widely used CAZyme annotation tool run_dbcan. It uses pyhmmer, a Cython bindings to
    HMMER3, to instead the cli version of HMMER3 suite as the backend for the search processes, which improves the multithreading
    performance. In addition, it also solves the inconvenience process in the run dbcan that the large sequence file required
    manual splitting beforehand.
 
    The main program dbcanlight comprises 3 modules - build, search and conclude. The build module help to download the required
    databases from dbcan website; the search module searches against protein HMM, substrate HMM or diamond databases and reports
    the hits separately; and the conclude module gathers all the results made by each module and provides a brief overview. The
    output of dbcanlight is resemble to run_dbcan with slight cleanup. Run_dbcan output the same substrate several times for a
    gene that hits multiple profiles with the same substrate; in dbcanlight we only report it once.
    
    Dbcanlight only re-implemented the core features of run_dbcan, that is searching for CAZyme and substrate matches by
    hmmer/diamond/dbcansub. Submodules like signalP, CGCFinder, etc. are not implemented.
