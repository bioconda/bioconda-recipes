  summary: The outcome of XCMS data processing strongly depends on the
    parameter settings. IPO ('Isotopologue Parameter Optimization') is a parameter
    optimization tool that is applicable for different kinds of samples and liquid
    chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry devices, fast and
    free of labeling steps. IPO uses natural, stable 13C isotopes to calculate a
    peak picking score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing the
    relative retention time differences within features and grouping parameters are
    optimized by maximizing the number of features showing exactly one peak from
    each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter settings are achieved
    by design of experiment. The resulting scores are evaluated using response
    surface models.
