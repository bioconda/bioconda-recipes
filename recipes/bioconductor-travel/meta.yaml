  summary: 'An utility to create an ALTREP object with a virtual pointer'
  description: 'Creates a virtual pointer for R''s ALTREP object which does not have the data allocates in memory. The pointer is made by the file mapping of a virtual file so it behaves exactly the same as a regular pointer. All the requests to access the pointer will be sent to the underlying file system and eventually handled by a customized data-reading function. The main purpose of the package is to reduce the memory consumption when using R''s vector to represent a large data. The use cases of the package include on-disk data representation, compressed vector(e.g. RLE) and etc.'
