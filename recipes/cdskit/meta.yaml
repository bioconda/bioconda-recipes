  summary: "A toolkit for processing protein-coding sequences (CDS)."
  description: |
    CDSKIT is a Python program that processes DNA sequences,
    especially protein-coding sequences. Many functions of this program are
    designed to handle DNA sequences using codons (sets of three nucleotides)
    as the unit, and therefore, edits the coding sequences without causing a
    frameshift. All sequence formats supported by Biopython are available in
    this tool for both inputs and outputs.
