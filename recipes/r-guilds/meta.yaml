  summary: A collection of sampling formulas for the unified neutral model of biogeography and
    biodiversity. Alongside the sampling formulas, it includes methods to perform maximum
    likelihood optimization of the sampling formulas, methods to generate data given
    the neutral model, and methods to estimate the expected species abundance distribution.
    Sampling formulas included in the GUILDS package are the Etienne Sampling Formula
    (Etienne 2005), the guild sampling formula, where guilds are assumed to differ in
    dispersal ability (Janzen et al. 2015), and  the guilds sampling formula conditioned
    on guild size (Janzen et al. 2015).
