  summary: 'MEDIPS was developed for analyzing data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation
    (MeDIP) experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, MEDIPS provides
    functionalities for the analysis of any kind of quantitative sequencing data (e.g.
    ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others) including calculation of differential coverage
    between groups of samples and saturation and correlation analysis.'
