  description: 'TWILIGHT (Tall and Wide Alignments at High Throughput) is a tool designed for ultrafast and ultralarge multiple sequence alignment. It is able to scale to millions of long nucleotide sequences (>10000 bases). By default, TWILIGHT requires an unaligned sequence file in FASTA format and an input guide tree in Newick format to generate the output alignment in FASTA format. When a guide tree is unavailable, users can utilize the iterative mode, which provides a Snakemake workflow to estimate guide trees using external tools.'
