  summary: 'Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is a non-parametric, unsupervised method
    for estimating variation of gene set enrichment through the samples of a expression
    data set. GSVA performs a change in coordinate systems, transforming the data
    from a gene by sample matrix to a gene-set by sample matrix, thereby allowing
    the evaluation of pathway enrichment for each sample. This new matrix of GSVA
    enrichment scores facilitates applying standard analytical methods like functional
    enrichment, survival analysis, clustering, CNV-pathway analysis or cross-tissue
    pathway analysis, in a pathway-centric manner.'
