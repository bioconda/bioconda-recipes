  summary: Nextstrain toolchain (meta-package)
  description: >
    Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public
    health potential of pathogen genome data.  It includes a collection of
    open-source tools to aid in our understanding of pathogen spread and
    evolution, especially in outbreak scenarios.  These tools are designed to
    be used with a wide range of data sources and designed to be modular so
    they can be replaced with your own tooling when necessary.
