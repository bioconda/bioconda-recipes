extra:
  notes: 'biopet-vcffilter is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell
    script. By default ''no default java option'' is set in the wrapper. The command
    that runs the program is ''biopet-vcffilter''. If you want to overwrite it you
    can specify memory options directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence. For example run it with ''biopet-vcffilter
    -Xms512m -Xmx1g''. '
