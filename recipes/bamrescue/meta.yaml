  summary: Utility to check BAM files for corruption and repair them by skipping corrupted BGZF blocks
  description: |
    bamrescue is a command-line tool that inspects Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) files for corruption.
    It leverages the BGZF structure (concatenated gzip blocks) to skip over corrupted sections using CRC32 checksums,
    rescuing as much valid data as possible.
