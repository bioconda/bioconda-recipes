  summary: EricScript is a computational framework for the discovery of
    gene fusions in paired end RNA-seq data. It is able to generate synthetic
    gene fusions by using the EricScript simulator and calculate a number of
    statistical measures for evaluating gene fusion detection methods
    performance with EricScript CalcStats.
