  summary: A lightweight distribution of iRAP without binaries. Nuno Fonseca's
      iRAP tool is an integrated RNA-seq anlaysis pipeline. It's based on Make
      to link workflow steps and has old-style dependency management whereby a
      monolithic install process installs binaries distributed with the the
      tool.  This package installs a fork of the iRAP code where the
      distributed binaries have been removed. The idea is that individual parts
      of the iRAP codebase can be utiled outside of iRAP's Make workflow and
      using Conda's dependency management. THIS IS AN ALPHA PROJECT AND SHOULD
      NOT BE RELIED UPON.
