  summary: This project is a parser, validator and normalizer implementation for shorthand lipid nomenclatures, base on the Grammar of Succinct Lipid Nomenclatures project.
  description: |
        Goslin defines multiple grammers compatible with ANTLRv4 for different sources of shorthand lipid nomenclature. 
        This allows to generate parsers based on the defined grammars, which provide immediate feedback whether a processed lipid shorthand notation string is compliant with a particular grammar, or not. jGoslin uses the Goslin grammars and the generated parser to support the following general tasks. 1) Facilitate the parsing of shorthand lipid names dialects. 2) Provide a structural representation of the shorthand lipid after parsing. 3) Use the structural representation to generate normalized names.

  notes: |
    jgoslin is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default
    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
    set globally this will take precedence.
    For example run it with "jgoslin -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
