  summary: The MethPipe software package is a computational pipeline for analyzing bisulfite sequencing data (WGBS and RRBS). MethPipe provides tools methylation-specific technical evaluation of sequencing data, and for estimating methylation levels at individual cytosines. Additionally, MethPipe includes tools for identifying higher-level methylation features, such as hypo-methylated regions (HMR), partially methylated domains (PMD), hyper-methylated regions (HyperMR), and allele-specific methylated regions (AMR).
