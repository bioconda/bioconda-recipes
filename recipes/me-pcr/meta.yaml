  summary: Multithreaded Electronic PCR (in-silico PCR) based on NCBI e-PCR.
  description: |
    Multithreaded Electronic PCR (me-PCR) was developed by Kevin Murphy at
    Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. It is described in Murphy et al
    (2004) https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btg466 and was originally
    available from http://genome.chop.edu/mePCR (defunct). It was based on the
    public domain NCBI tool e-PCR by Gregory D. Schuler, described in Schuler
    (1997) https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.7.5.541 which was origially availble
    from ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/schuler/e-PCR/ (defunct). The final
    release of me-PCR was v1.0.6 (2008-02-18), and the author wrote that in
    general NCBI e-PCR should be used instead having been improved greatly
    over the years. The NCBI retired and withdrew the e-PCR webservice and
    command line tool on 2017-06-28, suggesting the online-only tool
    Primer-BLAST instead. However, this is not suitable for offline high
    throughput usage. See also Jim Kent's isPCR (aslo available in BioConda).
