  summary: "Find microsatellite repeat elements from sequencing reads and design PCR primers to amplify them"
  description: |
    Finds microsatellite repeat elements directly from raw 454
    or Illumina paired-end sequencing reads, and designs PCR primers
    to amplify these repeat loci in an automated fashion. Exact
    matches to repeats or 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and/or 6-mers are located
    and primer3 is then used to generate primer pairs to amplify
    regions containing microsatellite loci.
