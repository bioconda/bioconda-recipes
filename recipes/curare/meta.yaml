  summary: A Customizable and Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for RNA-Seq Experiments.
  description: |
        Curare is a freely available analysis pipeline for reproducible, high-throughput,
        bacterial RNA-Seq experiments. Define standardized pipelines customized for your
        specific workflow without the necessity of installing all the tools by yourself.
        Curare is implemented in Python and uses the power of Snakemake and Conda to build
        and execute the defined workflows. Its modulized structure and the simplicity of
        Snakemake enables developers to create new and advanced workflow steps.
