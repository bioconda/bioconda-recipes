  summary: Variable selection techniques are essential tools for model selection and estimation
    in high-dimensional statistical models. Through this publicly available package,
    we provide a unified environment to carry out variable selection using iterative
    sure independence screening (SIS) and all of its variants in generalized linear
    models and the Cox proportional hazards model.
