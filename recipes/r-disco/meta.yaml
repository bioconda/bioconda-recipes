  summary: Concordance and discordance of homologous gene regulation allows comparing reaction
    to stimuli in different organisms,  for example human patients and animal models
    of a disease. The package contains functions to calculate discordance and concordance
    score for homologous gene pairs, identify concordantly or discordantly regulated
    transcriptional modules and visualize the results. It is intended for analysis of
    transcriptional data.
