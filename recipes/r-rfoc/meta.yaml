  summary: Graphics for statistics on a sphere, as applied to geological fault data, crystallography,
    earthquake focal mechanisms, radiation patterns, ternary plots and geographical/geological
    maps.  Non-double couple plotting of focal spheres and source type maps are included
    for statistical analysis of moment tensors.
