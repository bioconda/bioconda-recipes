  summary: 'Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with biological
    replication. Implements a range of statistical methodology based on the negative
    binomial distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact tests, generalized
    linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq, it be applied to
    differential signal analysis of other types of genomic data that produce counts,
    including ChIP-seq, SAGE and CAGE.'
