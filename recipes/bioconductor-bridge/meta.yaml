  summary: 'Test for differentially expressed genes with microarray data. This package
    can be used with both cDNA microarrays or Affymetrix chip. The packge fits a robust
    Bayesian hierarchical model for testing for differential expression. Outliers
    are modeled explicitly using a $t$-distribution. The model includes an exchangeable
    prior for the variances which allow different variances for the genes but still
    shrink extreme empirical variances. Our model can be used for testing for differentially
    expressed genes among multiple samples, and can distinguish between the different
    possible patterns of differential expression when there are three or more samples.
    Parameter estimation is carried out using a novel version of Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo that is appropriate when the model puts mass on subspaces of the full parameter
    space.'
