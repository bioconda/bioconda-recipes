  summary: 'T cell line infections with HIV-1 LAI (BRU)'
  description: 'The expression levels of approximately 4600 cellular RNA transcripts were assessed in CD4+ T cell lines at different times after infection with HIV-1BRU using DNA microarrays. This data corresponds to the first block of a 12 block array image (001030_08_1.GEL) in the first data set (2000095918 A) in the first experiment (CEM LAI vs HI-LAI 24hr). There are two data sets, which are part of a dye-swap experiment with replicates, representing the Cy3 (green) absorption intensities for channel 1 (hiv1raw) and the Cy5 (red) absorption intensities for channel 2 (hiv2raw).'
