  summary: 'Set of functions for sparse matrix algebra. Differences with SparseM/Matrix are:  (1)
    we only support (essentially) one sparse matrix format,  (2) based on transparent
    and simple structure(s),  (3) tailored for MCMC calculations within GMRF.  (4) S3
    and S4 like-"compatible"  ...     and it is fast.'
