  summary: 'Genome wide studies of translational control is emerging as a tool to
    study verious biological conditions. The output from such analysis is both the
    mRNA level (e.g. cytosolic mRNA level) and the levl of mRNA actively involved
    in translation (the actively translating mRNA level) for each mRNA. The standard
    analysis of such data strives towards identifying differential translational between
    two or more sample classes - i.e. differences in actively translated mRNA levels
    that are independent of underlying differences in cytosolic mRNA levels. This
    package allows for such analysis using partial variances and the random variance
    model. As 10s of thousands of mRNAs are analyzed in parallell the library performs
    a number of tests to assure that the data set is suitable for such analysis.'
