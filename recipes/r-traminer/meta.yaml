  summary: Toolbox for the manipulation, description and rendering of sequences, and more generally
    the mining of sequence data in the field of social sciences. Although the toolbox
    is primarily intended for analyzing state or event sequences that describe life
    courses such as family formation histories or professional careers, its features
    also apply to many other kinds of categorical sequence data. It accepts many different
    sequence representations as input and provides tools for converting sequences from
    one format to another. It offers several functions for describing and rendering
    sequences, for computing distances between sequences with different metrics (among
    which optimal matching), original dissimilarity-based analysis tools, and simple
    functions for extracting the most frequent subsequences and identifying the most
    discriminating ones among them. A user's guide can be found on the TraMineR web
    page.
