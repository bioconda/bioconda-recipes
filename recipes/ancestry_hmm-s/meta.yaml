  summary: "Inferring adaptive introgression from genomic data using hidden Markov models"
  description: |
    Ancestry_HMM-S is a program designed to infer adaptive introgression from
    genomic data. It can both identify loci that has increased in frequency due
    to selection and quantify the strength of selection that has acted upon
    each locus.
